[int. a quiet, dark room. faint breathing can be heard fading in]
 
 
 Ah. You’re finally awake. That was quite the nap you took; I was beginning to think you would never wake up.
 
[Pause] 
 
 Where are you? [A small laugh, like the question is ridiculous] I didn’t think you hit your head that hard. You’re in your bedroom. Do you not enjoy how I have redecorated? 
 
[shifting, like someone is gesturing to the walls] 
 
 I couldn’t find any pins to stick the photos to the walls, so I used knives instead. [quiet, yet gleeful chuckle] It’s okay, you don’t need to worry about what your landlord will say. 
 
[Muttered]
 
 He won’t be coming around much anymore.  
 
[A pause, the sound of footsteps moving closer] 
 
[Normal tone]
 
 You look so pretty. 
 
[Sound of skin against skin] 
 
 [Quiet, tender] Your skin is so soft… Big, glistening eyes staring up at me. Heh, I can feel your cheeks heating up under my palm.
 
[Quick shift, like someone jerks away] 
 
 [Sharply] Stay still. [Softer] I saw that wince. Your head hurts, doesn’t it? Quick movements will only aggravate the wound. It might even make it worse, and I’m sure you wouldn’t want that, would you?[A sigh] I left your legs free because I thought you might like to… roam around. But [close, emphasised] do not think I won’t hesitate to tie you up if you misbehave. 
 
 
[A sigh] 
 
 There you go again. What, you thought we were friends? No no, darling. You are so much more than a friend to me. You… you are everything to me. [skin on skin contact, brushing lightly] You are… So close to perfection. The closest thing. But… Nobody ever truly sees that, do they? 
 
 
 Your friends… I see how they treat you. They only want you around when they need something from you… You remember how they left you all alone, don’t you? Even your ex… they left you too. Everyone is always leaving you. 
 
 [Shifting, someone sitting on a bed] But I see you. I see all of you for who you are. The ‘you’ that no one else ever took the time to truly see. The ‘you’ you keep locked away. It was so hard to find, darling, but it was so unbelievably worth it. I see you. I’ll never leave you. 
 
 That’s all you want, isn’t it? Someone to cherish you, to look at you like you are the most precious thing in the world? To never, ever leave you? 
 
[A pause, before a hum in satisfaction]
 
 I know, darling, I know. It’s hard when no one sees how special you are… But you are so special, so precious to me. Only I know how to treat you as you should be treated. 
Like royalty. Pampered, and treasured… you deserve it all. 
 
[A sigh, pause] 
 
 But you have to earn it, darling. That means being good, and following the rules. Oh, don’t look so scared, it’s nothing too bad. Just a few ground rules to keep you… safe. 
 
[Taking on a sterner tone] 
 
 This room will be locked at all times until you have earned your freedom. If you try to escape, I will know. And if you try to contact someone… well, it’s not like anyone will care, y’know? But I will know if you try. Which is why I have taken all devices that can be used to communicate out of your bedroom. Perhaps you will earn them back, if you are good. 
 
[Shifting, someone getting up from the bed] 
 
 Your meals will be brought to you at 9am, 1pm and 7pm on the dot. If you wish to have a snack, do not hesitate to let me know. I will provide it instantly.
 
[Muttered under breath] 
 
 If you are good. 
 
[Normal tone, leaning close] 
 
  Oh darling, this is all for your own good. I know best how to take care of you, after all, because I know you the most. One might say I know you inside and out. But- heh- perhaps we haven’t quite got there yet. One day, though. 
 
 Now, I will let you get adjusted to your new life here whilst I make a start on dinner. No no, you don’t need to tell me. I know exactly what you like. 
 
[A pause, satisfied sigh as footsteps begin to walk away] 
 
 We are going to have a wonderful time, darling. This is your house after all. You can relax here. Just… Remember that my rules come first. Understood? Heh, you’re so obedient. I like that about you. I will be watching you, darling, don’t forget that. I like looking at you, so my eyes will be forever on you. Only you. 
 
[Muttered under breath] 
 
 So you will never set a foot out of line. 
 
[Normal tone] 
 
 [Unbothered] Oh, nothing darling. Just me talking to myself. I’ll see you at dinner, okay? Be good. [Chuckle] 
 
[Lock clicks]
