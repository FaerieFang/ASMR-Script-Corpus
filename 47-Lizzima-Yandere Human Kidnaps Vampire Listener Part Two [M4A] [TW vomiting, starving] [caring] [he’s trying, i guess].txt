Shh, shh, love. Hey, hey, it’s okay. Shh. It’s me, it’s me. You’re safe; I’ve got you.
Here. Let me hold you, okay? It’ll be alright. Shh, shh, shh.
…
Okay.. let me just check some things, alright? 
God, you can barely- okay, that’s.. 

[SIGH]

Okay. Let me check your eyes. I’m going to shine a light in, okay?
[CLICK]
Woah, hey, hey! It’s okay, calm down. You’re alright. 
Gods, you’re shivering. 
Hey, love, hey. Shh, you’re going to be fine. 

[SAD CHUCKLE] heh, even like this, you take my breath away. You’re.. I love you. 
..[CLEARING THROAT]
Okay. Let me check your wrists and ankles—

Don’t hiss at me, love. 
Ah- no, no, don’t move..! you’ll make it worse.
Agh, come on. Work with me, here. 
Stop struggling or I will cuff them so tight you will be unable to move your fingers.
There. Good. 
Let me see your wrists. No, not your teeth-
Gods, you can’t even understand me, can you? 
Your eyes are unfocusing. 

Let me just.. 
[HE TAKES THEIR HANDS]
There we go. Let’s see- ohh, love.

Those silver chains really did a number on you, hmm? 
Well, dear, maybe if I didn’t have to cuff you so tight it wouldn’t hurt as much. 

I know, I know. Fighting so fiercely just wasn’t in your best interest, despite how you feel about your situation.  You shouldn’t have run.
You’re still shivering.
Uh, here; are you hungr- ah, thirsty? Heh.
I have some warm soup here for you, love. 
No, it’s—you know what it is. Don’t throw a fit my dear—you’ve not been gone for that long. You should know by now I won’t let you do this to yourself. 
Don’t fight me. 
Stop.
That’s good. Good.
Now, here. Let me feed it to you.
Mmm, you can barely move your arms. I doubt you’d be able to feed yourself. Now open up..
There you go. 
…
Don’t make that face, love. You need this to survive. I know it doesn’t taste that bad to you.
Drink some more.
Good.
[COLD] Stop throwing a fit. Drink the damn soup before I shove it down your throat.
There you go. That’s better. Thank you.
[UNAMUSED— “this mf-“ tone] Coughing? Really? 
Well, at least you’ve been fed.

Let me check your wrists again.
Shh, shh, don’t whimper. I know, I know. It hurts. Let me take you out of those chains, okay? 
[UHH, CUFF UNCUFF NOISES? ^^;]
There we go. Can you stand?
Mmmm, no. not at all. Alright. 
Let me just help you up, then. 
Don’t back away-
…are you doing alright? Hey, what’s—
..
You threw up your— I- [FRUSTRATED SIGH]
Alright, fine. 
Don’t eat, then. We have other things to attend to anyway. 
Come on, now. Let me carry you upstairs.
Oookay, come here.
[GRUNT]
There, I’ve got you. I’m going to take you up now. 
Mmhm, yes, upstairs. You need to bathe.

You’re not going to get anything done, dirty and unwound as you are. And now you’re… [HIDING DISGUST] covered in your own bile. 
[WARM, CONCERNED] You’re still shivering, too. Let’s run you a bath.

You can’t complain, my dear. You can barely get a word out as you are now. Besides, I think we’re past this, wouldn’t you agree? We are far too intertwined to be worried about such fickle things. 
I cannot trust you with a servant. I don’t trust them with you, either, for that matter. 
I hope you understand.
Now, let us go.

[WATER RUNNING, FAUCET TURNING OFF]

Come on. In you go.
There. I’m going to wash it all off with a cloth, okay? I know, I know. If you’d just taken care of yourself, it wouldn’t be like this, you know. You lcan’t regenerate without feeding. 
(SIGH)
I wish it wasn’t like this. I wish you would just…
Ah. Nevermind. Come, let’s get you clean.  
.. I love you. I… I hope you know that. I don’t want to have to hurt you, but.. I’m not sure where to go from here, my love. I tried to show you before you ran, but now? I.. I’m unsure if that will work. I can’t trust that you’ll accept things as they are, and it.. hurts.I just want you to be safe. That’s all I want.
I just want you to be safe. Happy, sure, but.. I want you alive. Whatever that takes, whatever that means. I want you to be able to enjoy what life has to offer, even with the sacrifices. I.. want you to be able to enjoy what I have to offer. 
What can I do? What will it take for you to.. to get it? 
I miss you.
I.. Oh, haha. Let me explain. I miss.. you being.. you..? like, I just.. I don’t know.
I’ve never seen you happy, you know. 
I’ve watched, loved you, for so long, and yet.. I’ve never seen you happy. I’ve seen the weak smiles, the pitiful jokes, but.. I’ve never seen you truly laugh. I’ve never seen you laugh until you can’t breathe, or be so touched you shy away. I’ve never seen you squeal in excitement, or blush, or—or..
….
….
(SIGH) I just want you to be happy. That’s all. 
No, no. No, you weren’t. You weren’t happy then. You starved yourself to the point of weakness. You pressured yourself with this huge secret. You never allowed yourself the love or care of others. You shouldered it on your own and ended up getting crushed by the weight of it. 
No, that’s.. You.. 
[SIGH] Don’t.. apologize.
 I find it admirable. 
[INCREDULOUS— responding to the most “riiight” face the listener can muster]  I do, really. 
Your stubbornness—your drive to not hurt anyone..  it’s really special. It’s just that.. despite that, I can’t let you harm yourself for the sake of others. Not anymore. ..So if you can’t see—if you don’t know that you’re doing it.. If that gives you comfort, I’ll do it all. I’ll do everything for you. I just want you to smile for me. I just want… you, whatever that entails. 
I love you.
..No, you don’t have to say anything. You’re too weak anyway. You can barely keep your head up, dear. Here. Let’s get you out of this bath, okay? I’ll get you dressed and put some salve on your injuries.
Ah—no, you’re right. I did say that. It’s true, without blood you cannot regenerate as fast as you should. I.. While you were.. away, I did some research. I’ll tell you of it later, when you can focus on it, okay? I don’t want to burden your mind now. You need to rest. The gist of it is that the salve should be able to help you heal. Not as fast as you could, obviously, but faster than you would have without it right now, okay? Now come on, let me dry you off.
[BATH DRAINING]
Okay, there you are. Let’s get these clothes on.
Yes, I know. You told me that already. I have to do it though. You and I both know you wouldn’t be able to put them on properly right now anyway. You’re weak and malnourished—not to mention, I think you may actually have caught something. 
Yes, vampires can get sick. Vampires aren’t Teflon, my dear. Now let’s get this on, okay? We can talk about this later. 
…and there we go. Nice and comfy, right? Now.. (GRUNT) Up you go. I’ll carry you to your room.
I renovated it while you were away. I know I said I didn’t think this would work, but.. I really do want you to be comfortable. I’ll do whatever I can to ensure that—no matter how long it takes or how many things I have to try.
Ah, you’re starting to drift off. Alright, here’s your new bed. I hope it’s comfortable. It is? Nice and warm? Good. I’m glad. Now, before I go, I do have to restrain you. No, don’t worry, it shouldn’t get in the way too much. 
Let’s get this chain on. 
[CLICK] There. It will be attached to the post over there, see? It’s part of the floor. You won’t be able to take it off. It reaches every part of the room, and it shouldn’t get in your way much.
Aha, you can barely keep your eyes open.
Here, it’s okay. I’ll stop talking. You don’t need to try to stay awake anymore. Get some rest, okay? I’ll keep you nice and comfy here.
Do you want me to play with your hair? 
I didn’t- ah, you’re too out of it to give a proper answer. I’ll just.. 
Does that feel good, my love? 
(LAUGH—LIKE AWHHWHH LIKE REACTING TO A PET DOING SOMETHING REALLY CUTE/FUNNY)
Awwhawhaw, you’re snuggling up against me. ..Even if you’re unaware…
(SAD CHUCKLE)
I love you. Get some sleep now.
Goodnight, my love.
