[muffled voice from behind a door] 

Sweetheart? You in there? 

[trying to open door]

Make a noise. Tell me where you are. 

Oh thank God . . . the door is stuck, okay? Give me a second . . . 

[door breaks]

[running steps] 

Hey, hey, I’m here, I’m here, look at me, sweetheart look at me. 

There’s so much blood, oh my god, hey, there you are. Easy, easy. I’m here. I told you I was coming, right? I’m sorry I’m late. 

[untying rope] 

Look at me, focus on me, what happened? What did they do to you? 

Wolfsbane? Shit. Where? 

Injected you with it? 

Whoa, whoa, stay awake, stay with me. We gotta get the wolfsbane out of your system. Hold on, I need to get to call for some help, okay? 

[phone dialing] 

Lydia? 

I’ve got [her/him]. But [he/she] is in rough shape. 

Wolfsbane IV. 

It’s bad, Lydia. How do I get it out of [his/her] system? 

Uh . . . I don’t know. I don’t see anything. 

Wait, yeah, the IV pole is here. 

No, they’re gone. I cleared out the last stragglers. 

Saline? Uh, yeah, yeah there’s a bag. 

I’ve never run one before, no. 

Okay. Let me put you on speaker. 

[putting phone down] 

Lyd? 

Yeah, I hear you. 

I got it. How do I find a vein? 

Sweetheart? Wake up, wake up now, there you are, hi. Listen, Lydia is on the line. She’s gonna help me patch you up, okay? 

No, no, don’t move. I need to get some fluids in you, all right? Got to flush the wolfsbane out. 

I know, you hate needles, but baby, I’ve got to do it. I’m not letting you die on me, okay? Not happening. 

Yeah, it’s in, Lyd. How do I make sure the fluid is running? 

Right. Okay. 

Sweetheart? 

[tapping cheeks] There you are. I know, you’re tired, but you gotta hang on for a bit longer. No nap time right now, okay? 

I know, I know, you can be upset with me later, all right? 

How long will this take, Lydia? 

Okay. All right. 

Look at me. There you are. 

Of course I came. You think some werewolf hunters could stop me? They just delayed me a bit. 

No, no, none of that nonsense.

You are not a monster. You’re not. You’re a werewolf, yeah, but that doesn’t make you inherently evil. 

No, it doesn’t. 

Because my [boyfriend/girlfriend], the one who surprises me with breakfast in bed, the one who buys me flowers just because, isn’t a monster. 

No. You’re not. 

The hunters don’t know you. They think they do, but they’re wrong. They are so fucking wrong. 

I love you too. So much. 

No, none of this farewell crap. You’re gonna be fine. 

Hey. I mean it. You are going to be fine. We’ll get you fixed up. Get you out of here and then, get you home. 

Yeah, of course. Whatever you want. Just stay with me. 

Lydia, she’s fading out. What do I do? 

I’ve got it running as fast as it will go. 

Right. Okay. Let me check. 

[looking through drawers] 

No. Not here. 

Come on, where is it? 

[coming back to listener] 

Got it. It’s red, right? 

All right. 

Sweetheart, you need to drink this. 

I know, you can sleep later, but right now, you need to drink this. It will make you feel better. 

Don’t go limp on me, no, no, hey, eyes open. Shit! 

[VA drinks liquid and then kisses listener] 

. . . sweetheart? 

Lydia, [he/she’s] not moving. 

What do I do, [he/she’s] not–! Don’t do this to me. Don’t leave me. No, no, please just come back! 

[He/She’s] not breathing, Lydia. I need some help! 

Five minutes is five too many! 

Come back to me, please. 

[doing CPR] 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5–

–there’s a pulse! Thank god. 

Lydia, give me something! 

I’ve never cast that before. I don’t know–

–okay, okay. Just tell me what to do! 

[magic sound]

It worked but . . . [he/she’s] still not waking up. 

How far are they? 

Fuck. 

Come on, come back to me. Don’t leave me like this. 

[distant sirens] 

I hear them, Lyd. Can I trust them? 

Good. 

[running steps as paramedics enter] 

It’s wolfsbane poisoning. [He/She’s] flatlined once. I did CPR. 

It’s okay. I’m right here. I’m right here with you. 

[transition to hospital sounds] 

They said they flushed it from [his/her] system but . . . [sighing] 

I know. But if I hadn’t been so stupid. 

I left [him/her] there. When I knew there were hunters in town! I left and now–

–fuck, Lydia. If [he/she] dies, I’ll never forgive myself. 

Just find them, Lydia. Find them so I can end them myself. 

[phone hanging up]

[silence for a bit] 

. . . you must be loving this, huh? You always said you never got enough sleep. Here you are. Napping. At least . . . I would rather call it napping. Their word for it . . . well, you know me, ever the optimist. 

I have to be because if I lose you, I’m not gonna make it. And I’m not just saying that. I feel it. Deep within my soul. This bond we have . . . this connection . . . it’s alway been comforting to me. I remember when we first started dating and you’d be a few hours away, I used to miss you so much. But I could feel your presence. Warm. Comforting. Safe. 

But it’s cold right now. I can’t feel you. And that scares the shit out of me. The last time I felt like this was before I met you. I was drifting. Angry. Looking for revenge. Never planning to fall in love with anyone, let alone a werewolf. 

And then I saw you. Kneeling in mud by the lake, helping get a duckling out of plastic. It was quacking at you and you were just talking back. All of the sudden, my life just clicked. The picture shifted into focus. Everything was clearer. Brighter. Better. 

Because of you. 

I knew what you were. I’m the kid of hunters. I figured it out. But I just didn’t care. So what if you became a wolf once a month? You didn’t hurt anyone. You chained yourself up. You planted wolfsbane to keep you from leaving the house, even though it gives you headaches. That’s not what a monster does. 

Because you’re not a monster. 

My whole life, I was trained to kill creatures. Protect the innocent. But you are innocent. And I . . . I was supposed to protect you. I failed. When you needed me, I wasn’t there. I should’ve been. I’m sorry. 

When you get out of here, we’re gonna go on a trip, just you and me. To the beach. We can go swimming. I know how much you like the fresh sea breeze. It will be nice. Or maybe we can go to a carnival or something. Look at the stars on the ferris wheel. 

I don’t really care what we do, long as you’re there with me. Sappy, I know. 

I’m gonna find the bastards that did this to you. Gonna make them suffer more pain than they put you through. I know you don’t like revenge, but . . . if I don’t handle them, they’ll just keep coming after you. I can’t let that happen. I won’t. 

So, you take your time. You rest. As much as you need to. Just come back to me, okay? Show me that bright smile of yours. 

Because I’m lost without it, sweetheart. 

I’m not going anywhere. I’ll wait. When you’re ready, come back. I’ll be here.
