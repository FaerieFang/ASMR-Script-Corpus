(door unlocks)

(heavy door creaks open)

(walking down wooden, creaky stairs)



Hey Hon.



I'm back.

Just to state the obvious.



(short pause)



Oh, I know Sweetie. Leaving you down here must feel like some sort of punishment to you. But I swear it wasn't. At least, it wasn't meant to be.



(short pause)



Oh come on, Hon. It wasn't that bad down here was it? I mean, at least it's clean right?

Well, as clean as it CAN be with a dirt floor. And it's not like I just tossed you down here and left you in the dark, right?

I mean I left you with a cot, and chair, and even a couple of magazines to help you pass the time.



(short pause)



Well I'm sorry Hon, but the electric lantern's all I could come up with. I just don't have an extension cord long enough to reach down here, and grampa never bothered putting wires in here. He hardly ever even used this old root cellar.



(short pause)



Well I know it's a wee bit chilly down here Sweetie. That's what the blankets were for. And trust me, it's a lot colder outside.



(short pause)



Okay, that's enough!



(long pause)



I'm.....

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I snapped at you Cupcake. You have every right to be upset. But look, it was either this or leave you tied up for hours. I thought this'd be a little more comfortable for you, that's all. I mean taking you was a spur of the moment sort of deal. It's not like I had a chance to get you a leg chain or anything.



(short pause)



Yeah, I guess that does sound a little crazy.

Out of context.

Look. Like you said, it's a little chilly down here. How about we just go upstairs now, okay? I'll fix you a nice, hot bowl of soup and we can talk. That sound good Hon?



(short pause)



Okay Sugar. Come on up then. We'll get you warmed up.



(stairs creaking)



(long pause)



(crackling fire for the rest)



Okay Hon, got the fire going. You done eating already?



(short pause)



Oh don't bother Hon. Just leave it there on the table. I'll take care of it later. Why don't you come on over here and join me?



(short pause)



Oh come now Sugar. You really going to sit way over there? Uh-uh. Over here with me, close to the fire.



(short pause)



(sigh)



Oh why do you have to be so damned contrary?

Uh- uh. C'mere.



(slight grunt as she grabs him and carries him to the chair)



Honestly Cupcake, I don't get why you're so stand-offish. I mean is it really so bad, sitting in my lap like this?

My arms wrapped around your waist and my chin resting on your shoulder?

You've got a hot bowl of soup warming your insides and a nice, cozy fire warming your outside. So just relax and enjoy it, okay?

Just.....



(voice quivers) Just let me have this.

Please?



(short pause)



(whispers) thank you....



(long, heavy sigh)



(long pause as the fire crackles)



I know you don't want to be here.

Honestly, I don't blame you. But it's all I could think of.



(short pause)



Why did I do this? I told you hon. I couldn't just watch you drink yourself to death. I....

I just couldn't.

I can't. Not again.



(short pause)



Yes hon. Again.



(long pause as the fire crackles)



I told you Gramps left. Do you remember?



(short pause)



Yeah. I'm guessing you know what I meant by that. He passed. Ten years ago.



(short pause)



No Hon. Not ten years ago today. Christmas Eve was his last day here.

In a way I guess it was a sort of blessing. At least he's not in pain any more.



(short pause)



Good guess hon. Yes, it was cancer. The kind you can't cure.

He didn't want to die in some hospital bed. He wanted his last days to be here, on his old farm. He once told me it's the only place he's ever felt at ease. Comfortable.

And being his only family, I wound up taking care of him.

I'd go into town to get his medicine and supplies, I'd cook for him, I'd clean up after him, I'd.....

I'd get his whiskey.

I'd watch him down a bottle every day, trying to ease the pain.

The worse it got, the more he'd drink.

And I'd keep getting it for him, because I knew deep down there was nothing else I could do.



(sniffles, voice quivering)



All I could do was watch him drink himself to death.

All I could do was HELP him drink himself to death.



(long pause)



(slow, heavy sigh)



I'm sorry Hon.

I really shouldn't be telling you this. I know you've got problems of your own to deal with. I just....

I just can't. I can't just sit by and watch someone else I care about go through that.

Not again.



(short pause)



Hm? Why work at a bar then?

Fair enough. I do see people drinking like....

Well, like you were.

It doesn't happen that often though. Mostly around the holidays.

People coming in to drown their sorrows or find some semblance of companionship.

People who go there because they don't have any place else to be.

Or anyone else to be with.

People like me.



(long pause as the fire crackles)



Hey Sweetie? What were your plans this year?

For Christmas, I mean.



(short pause)



You didn't have any?

Pretty much what I figured. You just didn't seem like you cared about that sort of thing lately.



(short pause)



No Hon. I haven't celebrated since.....

well you know.

But you know what? I think it just might be a little better this year.



(short pause)



What do I mean? Well while I was in town I did a little shopping hon.

I actually went and got a tree.

I figured if you want, you could help me decorate it tomorrow.



(short pause)



Uh-huh. I still have most of the old ornaments up in the attic. I even got you some presents to put under the tree.



(short pause)



Oh that's all right Sugar. I know you couldn't get me anything. It's fine.

The only present I'd ever want from you is a warm hug and an honest smile.

And if you still can't give me a smile by then.... we'll I'll just take a rain check.

So how about it Cupcake? Want to help each other forget our problems for a day?

Neither one of us deserves to be alone for Christmas.

So just spend it with me.
