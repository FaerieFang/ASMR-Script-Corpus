[The speaker is softly humming, which gradually gets louder as the listener wakes up] 
 
(sang) you are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy, when skies are gray, you’ll never know dear, how much I love you, please don’t take my sunshine away…
 
[short pause]
 
Oh! You’re finally awake! I was starting to get worried! 
 
[pause]
 
(panicked) Oh goodness please don’t shout, I know it’s scary but I promise I won’t hurt you.
 
[the listener continues to shout and struggle]
 
(gentle shushing) hey now, it’s okay, look at me, yes that’s right, look into my eyes. 
There’s my precious little darling. Hi, I’m sure you have a ton of questions, and I promise I’ll try to answer them as best I can, but you have to promise me you won’t shout, okay?
 
[short pause]
 
Good, good, alright then.
 
[pause]
 
Where are you? Well, you’re in my house. In my basement to be exact. Now I know that when you hear the word basement you must think grimy and dark and cold, but I promise you I made all the necessary preparations to make sure that you’d be comfortable in here. I have a space heater in the corner, and there are plenty of lights, not to mention glow in the dark star stickers for when it’s bedtime.
I also set up a bed for you, and there are some cosy blankets so you can bundle up. I wanted to wait until you were awake to bring down any entertainment because I wanted to make sure I got exactly what you wanted.
 
[pause]
 
Where is my house? Well, uhm… well I can’t say exactly, but I will tell you that I live very far out in the countryside, at least an hour and a half drive to any city. There aren’t many people around these parts.
 
[pause]
 
(apologetic) Oh, I know that’s not a very satisfying answer, but I can only tell you so much. I want to make sure you feel safe and comfortable, so I’ll tell you as much as I can, but some things need to wait until I can trust you more.
 
[pause]
 
My name? Well, you can call me any name you like, darling, but if you’d really like to know my name is _____. (insert name at your discretion)
 
[pause]
 
How’d you get here? Well, that one is simple. Every night before bed, you have a cup of tea to wind you down. It wasn’t very hard to lace the teabags with a little something special to get you to go to sleep. After that all it took as getting you here. Although you took a while to wake up, I was worried I might have given you too much for a moment there.
 
[pause]
 
(sounding hurt) Crazy? W-well that’s not very nice, darling. I’m not crazy I’m just… willing to do what’s necessary for love. 
 
[pause]
 
P-please don’t say stuff like that, darling, I swear I’m not crazy. I’d never do anything to hurt you, honest! I know it must be scary, being in a new place, far away from home, but I didn’t bring you here to do anything bad! I… I love you.
 
[pause]
 
(sigh) I think it’s best if I give you a bit to cool off. You’re hungry right? I’ll go make you something to eat. In the meantime you just sit tight, okay?
 
[door opens and shuts, after a few moments of silence the door opens again]
 
Darling, I’m back! I made breakfast. I’m sure you’re hungry, you’ve been asleep for quite a while.
 
[short pause]
 
You’ve calmed down. Good. I want to make sure that you’re as happy and comfortable as possible, okay? Anyway, it’s nice and warm, so you should eat up before it gets cold. Here, I’ll feed it to you.
 
[pause]
 
Drugged? Why would you think I drugged it?
 
[pause]
 
Well, yes, I did say that didn’t I… H-how about this? I’ll take a bite of everything so that you don’t have to worry.
 
[The speaker takes a few bites]
 
See? It’s all safe. Here.
 
[utensil clink]
 
Open wide.
 
[pause]
 
Well of course I’m feeding you silly, I can’t release your hands just yet, you haven’t adjusted. Once you feel more at home here I’ll let you roam around a bit, but for now, you’ve gotta stay chained to the wall. 
 
[pause] 
 
(sigh) I know it’s hard, but you should at least eat for now and we can have a talk later. Now why don’t you open up?
 
[pause]
 
Hmm, that’s better. 
 
[pause]
 
Is it good? I’ve been working on perfecting some of your favorites, but I’ve never had someone else taste them before.
 
[short pause]
 
It is? Oh goodness darling that makes me so happy! Here, have some more.
 
[utensil clink]
 
There you go. Oh, you’ve got a bit on your chin, here, let me just…
 
[the speaker leans forward and wipes the listener's face with their thumb, then licks it clean]
 
There, all better.
 
[pause]
 
Huh? Well of course I licked it off my finger, would you rather I had you lick it off?
 
[short pause]
 
(giggles) You look so cute when you’re flustered. 
 
[utensil clink]
 
Aw come on now, don’t get all shy all of a sudden. Just a couple more bites, okay?
 
[pause]
 
Good. (giggle) There’s no point in trying to hide your face, I can still see you just fine. Gosh, you’re just the most adorable little thing.
Alright, last one, then you can have some juice, okay?
 
[utensil clink]
 
Alright, here you go, open your mouth just a little bit
(dreamy sigh) you look so cute, you know that? I can’t wait for us to spend the rest of our lives together.
 
[pause as the listener starts coughing on the juice]
 
Oh no! Did I go too fast? I didn’t mean to make you choke, darling! Are you alright?
 
[pause]
 
That’s not it? W-what is it then?
 
[pause]
 
Huh? Darling? Did I say something wrong?
 
[pause]
 
Well of course I said the rest of our lives silly, you’re staying here forever. We belong together! I know you can’t see it now but I promise you that one day you’ll understand! Together we can be truly happy!
 
[pause]
 
(raising voice) Now don’t start with that again, I told you I’m not crazy!
 
(gasp) I-I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to shout. 
 
[The speaker gathers up the dishes]
 
I-I’m gonna go put these away. I think we both need a minute to cool off. 
 
[door opens, the speaker turns back to take one last look at the listener]
 
Hey darling? I love you.
 
[door shuts]
