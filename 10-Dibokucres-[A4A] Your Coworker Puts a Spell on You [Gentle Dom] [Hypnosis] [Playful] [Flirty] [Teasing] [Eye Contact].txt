Hey.
(Chuckle)
Didn’t hear me the first time, huh?
[Amused] The way you were staring at your monitor there, it almost looked like you were hypnotized.
(Chuckle)
 
I asked if you wanted to get lunch together.
It's been such a slow day... 
I'm the only one there in my office, and it looks like it's the same for you.
So, I figured, might as well grab a bite together, right?
Let's sneak off to that Italian place around the corner.
Their Carbonara is just *divine*.
Besides… I’d love to get to know you a little better.
I always enjoy our little chats, but we've never gotten the chance to really… talk.
Come on, it will be fun, you’ll see.
[Teasing] I’m very interesting, I promise.
And the food there is really, really good.
Please?
As a favor to me?
[Pause]
There’s no need to be so tense, I don’t bite.
[Teasing] Well, not on the *first* date, at least.
[Pause]
[Confused] No? But...
(Sigh)
[Disappointed, sad] No, it’s all right.
[Disappointed, sad] Maybe some other time then.
[Pause]
Although...
[Pensive] You know… you really did look zoned out there, when I came in.
 
[Teasing] You’ve got to be careful with that, you know.
Some unscrupulous hypnotist might decide to take advantage.
[Seductive] Make you obey their every command.
Mmhmm.
You probably wouldn’t even see it coming.
It’s not like they just walk up to you, snap their fingers and tell you to sleep (chuckle).
It doesn’t work quite like that.
 
[Shift to hypnotic, soothing tone]
No, they start by just talking to you.
Speaking softly. Soothingly.
Making sure all of your attention is completely fixated on one particular thing.
Like on a screen… or a pocket watch… or maybe even their eyes.
You must have seen it on TV.
Somebody staring unblinkingly at a spiral... or being completely transfixed by a pocket watch?
[pause]
 
[A little more conversational]
Yes, they’re quite common tropes.
[Dismissive] But really, spirals, pocket watches, those are not the things you should be worried about.
They are too obvious, to catch anyone unaware.
I mean, they work perfectly well on people who *want* to be hypnotized.
But...let’s say I pulled out a spiral right now, like, on my phone.
You'd be on your guard, right?
You wouldn't just stay relaxed.
You wouldn't keep listening to my voice.
No, it's impossible to hypnotize anyone against their will with a *spiral*.
[Amused] And well (chuckle), who even carries a pocket watch these days?
 
[Shift to hypnotic, soothing tone again]
But *eyes*… everybody's got eyes.
It's not even unusual to talk about them.
It’s remarkable how often the eyes are mentioned when talking about how attractive someone is.
And keeping eye contact is entirely normal, expected even.
Yes.
Keep eye contact with me, please.
Very good.
I know it can make some people feel a little uneasy.
But there’s no need for that.
Please... just relax.
[Pause]
That’s better.
So... as I was saying...
There’s really nothing strange about looking someone in the eyes.
It definitely doesn’t immediately make you think of hypnosis.
Even the thought of getting hopelessly lost in my eyes… that just sounds *romantic*... doesn’t it?
Yes.
But some people… some people are lucky enough to be blessed with *exceptionally* fascinating eyes.
Gorgeous, magnetic eyes that draw your attention and pull you in.
Eyes like that are just perfect for luring an unsuspecting victim into a deep, hypnotic trance.
Eyes like mine.
[Short pause]
Don’t you think so?
(Chuckle) Look at you, all flustered.
[Earnest] I'm serious, I want to know what you think.
[Back to soothing, hypnotic] Take a moment… and consider it.
Look into my eyes... and tell me.
Do you think someone could get hypnotized by my eyes?
[Mulling it over] Mmhmm.
Let me give you a better view, so you can give me a more... informed opinion.
Just relax and let me sit on your lap.
(Optional SFX: as if sitting down in listener’s lap)
(Chuckle)
[Admonishing] Oh, hush now.
I know that you’re too shy to say anything, but…
[Intimate whisper] I’ve seen the way you look at me, when you think I don’t notice.
[Intimate whisper] I *know* how you really feel about me. …
So... I also know that you don’t actually mind when I get this close to you.
Stop pretending that you don’t want this, hmm?
Just admit it. This is a dream coming true for you... isn’t it?
To be so intimate with me.
To feel my arms wrapped around you.
And to see my eyes from so very close.
That's right.
I've noticed the way you glance at my eyes from time to time... always looking away again whenever I meet yours.
(Chuckle)
It’s all right.
I think it’s cute.
And I know my eyes are intriguing.
It’s only natural to want to have a better look.
There’s no need to look away from them now.
You can gaze into my eyes for as long as you want.
Go on.
Look into my eyes.
And tell me if you find them… hypnotic.
Yes...
There’s definitely something about them, isn’t there?
There’s something about my eyes that makes them… irresistible.
Uh-huh.
They are so colorful… and yet…. It’s so hard to pin down what color they actually are.
There's so much complexity to my eyes... so much *depth*.
Look a little deeper.
There’s no rush.
Take your time.
Really focus on my eyes.
That’s it.
Just relax and keep looking.
They are *incredibly* fascinating, aren't they?
Mmm. Entrancing, even.
You know... I’m thinking my eyes could *most definitely* hypnotize someone.
[Slightly amused] Someone like you.
(Slight chuckle)
I can tell you're being pulled in.
But... you’re not looking away, are you.
Maybe you haven’t realized yet what’s going on.
Or maybe you’re already caught like a deer in my headlights.
It doesn’t really matter.
What matters it that it feels *good* to lose yourself in my eyes.
It feels *good* to follow my instructions, to do what I tell you to do.
Yeah.
Just relax and enjoy this.
Let go.
Give in.
Keep listening to my voice.
And keep sinking into my eyes.
Yes.
I can see you are starting to drift away.
Just like I knew you would.
I’m going to hypnotize you, darling.
It’s inevitable at this point.
Sure, there’s still a chance you could stop yourself from falling deeper and deeper into my eyes.
Maybe you could even manage to look away.
But… you know that if you do… this moment passes.
I would get up and walk away.
Laugh all of this off as a joke.
And you'd *never* get to lose yourself in my eyes again.
You'd never get to feel this *good* again.
And so…  you just keep sitting there.
Gaze up into my pretty, pretty eyes.
You listen to every word I say.
Do everything I tell you.
And sink.
Deeper and deeper.
Deeper into trance.
That's it.
I am hypnotizing you.
And that's perfectly all right.
You don't mind at all.
[Teasing, smile in the voice] Hypnosis can't make you do anything you don't want to do, after all.
But... that's kind of a moot point, really.
Because there is nothing you don’t want to do for me right now, is there?
No.
You would do *anything* to keep feeling this good.
That’s how hypnosis works.
You decide to go along with whatever I tell you... because it feels so very wonderful to listen to me.
To let me take control.
To be so completely focused on me.
On my voice… and my eyes.
You don’t even notice that your mind keeps slowing down… down… down.
Becoming softer and more pliable with every passing second you spend gazing into my eyes.
With every word I say to you.
And... at some point… listening and following stops being a decision anymore.
There comes a moment when your mind has just become too mushy to do anything but absorb the words I'm pouring into your ears.
A moment when all of your own thoughts have melted and leaked out of your head.
When the only thing that's left in there is the sound of my voice.
When your mind is teetering right on the edge of consciousness.
When all of your defenses are poised to come tumbling down.
Leaving your mind completely open and vulnerable and ready for programming.
And *that*, is when the hypnotist tells you to... *sleep*!
 
[Longer pause]
… (sfx: fingersnap) wide awake. 
[Excited curiosity] So… what’s the last thing you remember?
Me telling you to sleep?
[Pause]
(Pleased chuckle) Good. Very good.
I see hypnotizing you worked just perfectly.
[Slight pause]
I told you you had to be careful, didn't I?
[Teasing] Say "yes Mistress/Master."
(Chuckle)
Oh, I'm going to have *so* much fun with you.
[Teasing] But first… lunch.
[Teasing] You aren’t saying “no” to me ever again, darling.
