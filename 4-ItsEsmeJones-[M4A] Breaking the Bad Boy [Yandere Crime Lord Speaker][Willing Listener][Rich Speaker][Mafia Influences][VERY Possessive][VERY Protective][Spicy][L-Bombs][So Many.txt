[Scene opens on the city streets outside a fancy restaurant]

[SFX: A call being made and then answered]

“Hello? Now really isn’t a good time, Miguel!”

[SFX: Faint gunshots]

“Actually, hang on, I think I have one more grenade!”

[SFX: An explosion and the Speaker cackling maniacally]

“THAT’S RIGHT, YOU BITCH-ASS-!”

[Pause?]

[The second he hears your voice, his voice turns sugary sweet. Adoring]

“Baby! Oh, honey bunny, I didn’t realize it was you. My super cute little ringtone for you was drowned out by all the gunfire, haha. How’s your day going, sweetie?”

[Pause?]

“...oh, fuck. Stan! STAN, YOU DENSE CLOWN-NOSED BITCH! You were supposed to remind me I had a dinner date! Stop bleeding out and answer for your crimes! Oh, for fuck’s… here, have a bandaid, you baby.”

[Pause?]

[His voice tilts back again, sweeter than honey]

“Baby, I am SO gosh-darned sorry. I was just finishing up on set and lost track of time! Don’t you worry, I’m on my way now, I’m gonna buy you a whole jewelry store, OK? Then we can go look at the kittens, I know how much you love adopting animals and taking care of them. Does that sound OK?”

[...]

“...a-a…a break?”

[SFX: The chaos in the background silencing itself]

“No. No, no, no baby! Baby! C’mon now, I know I messed up, but I’ll buy you a private island if that makes you happy! OK?!”

[Pause…]

“Emotionally unavailable? No, no no no no no, Baby! Baby, please, you know Donnie loves his little sugar angel, right? You know he does! No, don’t move in with your sister, baby-!”

[He falls quiet while you assure him you still love him, there’s no one else, you just need to evaluate your priorities while he evaluates his]

“Baby! No, c’mon, don’t do this! Please, c’mon, I’m getting in the limo right now, I’ll take you to a trillion star lunch and we can talk about this!”

[Pause]

“Damnit, I love you, too! I don’t want to let you go, OK?! Baby! NO, DON’T SAY YOU GOTTA GO-!”

[SFX: The call ending and, inevitably, your phone blowing up with calls and texts]

[It hardly takes ten minutes before his car pulls up alongside you as you walk your way home]

[SFX: A limo rolling along and a car window rolling down]

“Baby! Oh, I’m so glad I found you! No, don’t stop the car, just maintain this slow speed, driver!”

[He steps out of the limo, lugging an absurd amount of flowers]

“Baby, look! Look at all these pretty flowers, all for you! You could use some of that powder you have at home to plant them! Daddy bought you that greenhouse in your penthouse, remember? You were so happy!”

[Pause]

[He makes his usual slew of frustrated noises]

“OK, OK! No problem! Flowers no fix, OK, sure, putting them back in the limo! H-Here, how about this? It’s that diamond-sapphire necklace you said was pretty! See? Mmhm, it’s from a rare sunken ship, Baby, isn’t that neat? You love your historical antiques. See?! I listen! I care!!!”

[Pause]

[He deflates as you put your hand on his shoulder]

“No…? Donnie no fix? B-But…”

[Pause]

“Baby, no, I know that lingo. You saying you need a break means you’re gonna dump me proper! And then I’m going to have to live without you and a-agh… N-No, I can’t, I can’t do that again! I’ll worry constantly, Baby! What if someone gets you, huh?! What if I can’t find my Baby?!”

[Pause]

“OK…O-OK, space… Right, right, right, yes, space, mmhm… There isn’t another guy, right? Not that I don’t trust you but I know how sweet and innocent you can be and if someone fucking takes advantage of that and hurts you I am going to have to murder anyone that’s important to them…”

[He flinches as you cup his jawline but melts as you stroke his hair back]

“Mhm… Oh, your touch is so soothing… Keeps all the crazy out for a bit, haha…”

[Pause]

[He sighs, head hung]

“...OK. I’ll give you some space… But you’ll come home, right? Pinkie promise?”

[You pinkie promise and head on your way while your boyfriend watches you go, sadly clutching at a warehouse-sized bouquet]

[Scene transitions to your sister’s apartment]

[You get home from picking up some groceries and notice a few things as you come back inside: namely, the kitchen window being broken and your boyfriend sitting on the couch]

[...Pause…?]

[He rocks a little, claps his hands a few times and looks at you then looks away]

“So, um, I broke in. A little. Just a little! I gave your sister a few million, and bought some pizza for her kid.”

[Pause?]

[He gives a small, manic laugh]

“Am I OK??? No. No, I feel like I’m dying without you. It’s only been a few hours and I miss you so badly, I’m scared, I’m terrified, I NEED you, I need to protect you, every day, all the time… I’ll burn this fucking city to the ground if someone hurts you, OK?”

[Pause]

“Oh, right, babber in the house. I will burn this fricking city to the fricking ground!”

[You sit by him and he immediately just melts in your arms]

“Baby… Please tell me what you need from me to stay. Pretty please? I will do literally anything, sweetheart. Anything!”

[Pause]

[He sighs and pouts against your chest as you play with his hair]

“...You just want me to spend more time with you when I make commitments… Mmh, I know, I know I’ve been bad about that… I promise, I’m not trying to love-bomb you, Baby. Gift giving is my love language, you know?”

[Pause]

“Mhrlglrr, fine… I admit my emotional availability has been shite, even for a crime lord. It’s hard, you know? Throwing grenades and thinking about kissing you, shivving a guy while wondering what you might be doing… I miss you, too, honey bunny. I really do, and if we break-up, I just… I don’t know what I’d do…”

[Pause]

“Yeah, I know you don’t like how brutal my work can be. I know… But I gotta remind the boys who’s boss, you know? It’s gotten a lot safer! We introduced those cute little armor sets you recommended. Hmhm, you’re so smart, Baby. The boys love the daily donuts you suggested. You give this crime syndicate a… human side, I suppose… You give me a human side.”

[Pause]

[He grumbles as you play with his hair]

“Mrarl… Shut up, I am not “cute” when I’m needy. I was beating a guy’s head in earlier today and you’ve got me sat here, emotionally vulnerable, a little broken glass in my suit, telling you how important you are to me…”

[Pause]

[He sighs and pulls you close, still pouting]

“I love you, too… And if you date anyone else, I will make them disappear, you remember that. You’re my Baby. No one else’s, not ever. OK, honey bunny? Daddy doesn’t want to have to kill anyone…”

[That last sentence is very sing-song]

[Pause]

[He makes what you can best describe as: “happy crime boss noises” and nuzzles up to you]

“OK, Baby… I’m sorry I intruded on your space here. Could I maybe make it up to you with some breakfast? Maybe a shopping trip to the mall? Or, whatever you want to do. As long as I’m with you, OK?”

[<3 Pause <3]

[He giggles and gives you a big, domineering, passionate kiss]

“Mmh, kisses. I love my kisses from my Baby. I’ll pick you up at 10 AM, OK? I know you like to sleep in.”

[<3]

[He smiles and stands, going back to the busted window]

“Alright, I reckon I can jump through the window without cutting myself to ribbons… Hmm? Oh, right… the front door. Haha, you’re so smart, my cutie pie. Don’t fall in love with anyone else, OK, or I’ll kill ‘em! Haha, OK, love you Baby. See you tomorrow!”

[Despite your suggestion, he still…]

[SFX: Glass shattering again]

“...Woo, cleared it! Got the love of my life back! Potentially cut my calf open but that’s OK, woo!”

[He grins at you and vaults the balcony railing with one final:]

“I love yoooouuuuu!”

[SFX: A crash and maniacal giggling]

“I GOT ‘EM BACK, BOYS! YOUR BOSS AIN’T SINGLE NO MORE!”

[SFX: A fairly loud cheer and a limo peeling away]

[...he has his good qualities]

[The End?]
