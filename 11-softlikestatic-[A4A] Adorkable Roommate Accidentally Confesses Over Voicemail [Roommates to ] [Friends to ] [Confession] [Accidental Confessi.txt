*Listener’s phone alerts them that they have a missed call and a new voicemail. They unlock their phone and open their voicemail so they can listen to the new message. As the message starts to play, they can hear music playing faintly in the background.*

"Hey, I know you're at work right now and probably won't hear this until you're in your car and headed home, but I wanted to tell you not to pick up any dinner because I'm making some right now. And before you assume the worst, yes, I did actually follow a recipe last time. I learned my lesson after last time. Even though it wasn't actually that bad. I mean… depending on who you ask. The crows that hang out on the trash cans seemed to like it, at least. And you know what? That counts in my books."

*Narrator laughs.*

"But seriously, I actually did find a recipe to try out and it smells good. Like, really good. I think you'll really like it. It's got a lot of stuff you usually like. I've honestly been trying it as I go - which I get to since I'm the one making it so shut up - and it tastes great so far. I almost want to say that it tastes like what you got at the restaurant we went to last week, but that's probably putting too much faith in my own skill. I mean, even as talented and skilled and wonderful as I am, even I have to admit that my cooking skills… Well, they've needed some work."

*Narrator laughs again.*

"That's absolutely understatement, I know, but give me some credit, okay? I've been getting better! For the most part…"

"Anyway, that's not the reason I called you. Well, not the only reason. I also wanted to let you know that I also found the hoodie you thought you lost! It got caught between the far side of my bed and the wall. I'm willing to bet it fell over there when we were having our 'favorite childhood cartoons' marathon a few weeks ago. Speaking of which, we never actually got around to finishing the last season of Teen Titans, which is heartbreaking since that was the last show on our list, and my favorite cartoon of all-time."

"So I'm thinking that when you get home tonight, we should just hang out and watch the rest of it. The last season is so good, and we can eat dinner on the couch while we watch it! I even got us some dessert from the bakery down the street for after! It'll be the perfect date night!"

*Narrator pauses for a moment, their words finally hitting them. They start to talk faster, completely flustered by their slip-up.*

*Embarrassed, flustered* “I mean- I didn’t mean date night! I-I meant movie date! Wait, no! I meant movie night! What I meant to say was movie night! Oh my god, sorry, that’s so awkward. I was just thinking of like, how it totally sounds like a date, you know? You get home from work and I’ve made you dinner, and we eat together while watching a movie and maybe even cuddling a bit…”

*Narrator chuckles nervously.*

*Obviously lying* “Not that I think about that a lot- Or at all! I… don’t think about having date nights with you at all. Definitely not. Nope. Not at all.”

(Short Pause)

*Trying to hide their nervousness* “But I mean, would it really be so weird if I did? You and I are pretty good friends, and friends can sometimes do couple-y things, just for fun. I mean, we do couple-y things sometimes! And I like doing couple-y things with you! I honestly wish that we could do them more often, as if we were actually a couple. I think it would be a lot of fun! I think it would be really cool if we were a couple and I got to do couple things with you! I’d really love to date you!”

*Narrator abruptly stops, realization once again hitting them as they realize that they’re only digging themself further into this hole.*

*Flustered* “Oh god, I didn’t mean that. Well, I did, but I didn’t mean to tell you that! It’s just that, well, I think it would be nice to date you! I think that you’re really cute and funny and thoughtful, and-and you’re exactly my type, so dating you would be like a dream come true. I’ve kinda had a thing for you ever since the first time I saw you, and every day we’ve lived together, I just kept wanting to be with you more. Can you blame me? You’re a total catch!”

“Except that’s um… You don’t need to know that. Just ignore what I said, okay? Just forget everything. P-Please?”

“Oh, except what I said about you being a total catch. You really are, and you deserve to hear it. Even if this is the weirdest way to tell you that. But you really should know that you’re the kind of person that I could only hope to be with- I mean, that anyone could hope to be with.”

*There’s an awkward pause before Narrator groans.*

“Oh god, there’s no way I can fix this, is there? There is absolutely no way to salvage this.”

*Narrator chuckles, quiet and awkward.*

*Quiet, slightly sad* “I should’ve just hung up after I embarrassed myself the first time, huh? Now I’ve really made a fool of myself.”

*Narrator inhales before letting out a sigh.*

*Sheepish, nervous* “I think that I’ve said… more than enough.I should really shut up now. So uh… See you when you get here, I guess?”

*Narrator groans, clearly flustered.*

*Mumbling* “Oh my god, this is so embarrassing! I can’t believe I just said all that!”

*Narrator coughs, clearing their throat.*

"Yeah, I'll just… I'm gonna hang up now. I'll see you when you get home. Uh… yeah, bye.”

*Mumbling, sounding further from the phone* “Fuck. That… was not how I was hoping to say any of that. Oh god, please, please don’t hate me. I don’t know what I’d do if you did.”

*The voicemail ends.*
