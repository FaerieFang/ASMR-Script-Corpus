Why is she not awake yet? Did my minions let out too much sleeping smoke during our battle? What if she doesn' wake up?! What am I gonna do without my darling?!

Oh...! Oh, you're awake! Thank God, I was so worried about you. I almost panicked, to be honest. [Speaker laughs lightly]

Don't, don't try to move, dear. You won't be able to. The sleeping smoke my scientists created is quite strong, you see? You'll only be able to move completely after one hour or so.

Oh, please, don't look at me like that, darling! I promise I won't hurt you. I would never do that. Even when we fight, I never hurted you, did I? I'm always the one who gets beaten up. I'm not complaining, of course. [Speaker laughs]

(...)

Wow, you're already speaking! You're much more stronger than I thought you were. I'm impressed! You always surprise me in the most positive ways, darling!

Answering your question about what happened, we were in the middle of a fight when you noticed the smoke surrounding us. You thought I set fire to another bulding, like last time, but it was actually the sleeping smoke. And then you fainted. Don't worry, I caught you before you could reach the floor. And here we are! In my humble lair. Don't mind the mess, please.

(...)

What do I want? Well, that's a long story... for starters, look at my face. It's the first time you see me without my mask, right? At least, that's what you must be thinking, but it's not true. You saw my face two years ago, at the Heroe's Training Academy.

(...)

Of course you don't remenber me and I don't blame you. I wasn't as outspoken as I am right now.

Anyway, we were both students at the HTA, and since the first day of class, you caught my attention. With time, I fell completely in love with you. You were smart, honest, trustworthy and a really good person. You still are, of course.

I always saw you as someone who were too good to be here, in this rotted world, among these terrible people. A goddess! A light being, that was sended to protect and confort those who needed.

Life in the academy was horrible for me. I was one of the most weak students there, but I endured it all because of you. I can't count in my two hands how many times you fought those bullies to protect me and other students.

I promised myself that I would train until my body coudn't take it anymore, just so I could be a hero and enter the Hero's League with you. Of course, that is not what happend. You passed all the final tests, obviously, and I failed the last one. The psycologic test. I wonder why...

I was devasteded! How would I finally aproach you if I couldn't see you anymore?! How would I confess my undying love for you, if you would not be within my reach anymore? And then I figured out! What do heroes do? They fight villains and protect the city, so if I wanted to see you again I would need to be a villain! And so I turned into one of the most feared villains of this place! I did it all for you, my love!

(...)

No, I'm not sick! I just really, really, really love you! I would do anything for you!

(...)

Oh, the punches, slaps and kicks are nothing compared to the pleasure I feel every time I see you. And they were all coming from you, so I gladly accepteded.

(...)

Oh, God, of course I'm not a masochist! I only enjoy it when you're the one beating me up.

Please, don't give me that look, I'm starting to feel kinda self-conscious right now...

(...)

Well, yes. The fact that I'm in love with you is one of the reasons I took you with me, but... [The listener interrupts him]

(...)

I wouldn't say I kidnapped you, but if that is the word you want to use, no problem, my love.

As I was saying, the other reason why I... "kidnapped" you is because I know what is happening in the Heroe's League. I know they're mistreating you. Treating you like a burden, when you're the one who always fight the worst villains, and you're the one who always make sure to not hurt civilians or destroy the city during the battles. I know it all.

You look really surprised.

(...)

I'm not spying... yes, I am spying on you. There's no use in denying.

But I did it, because I wanted to make sure you were ok, and it turns out, you're not!

(...)

My love, of course I can help you! I have been preparing everything for months! I prepared this house, I prepared new clothes, a beautiful room, protection and even a new identity!

I know you were planning to escape the Heroe's League, but they discovered your plans and ruined everything! What is a shame, because I was really excited to see you in action. It was a really good plan too, I'm sorry you couldn't go through with it, dear.

When I saw what happended I decided that I would not just watch anymore, I would free you from them.

(...)

Darling, please, don't say that! I would never trap you like they did! I just took you... I mean, kidnapped you, so we could talk without their interference.

(...)

I know you don't trust me, and you're right. I have known you for two years, but you don't really know who I am. With time, as you get to know me, I hope you can warm up to me.

(...)

I'm... not letting you go. I'm sorry, but it's for your own good. If you at least had a safe place to go, I could take you there, I know you can take care of yourself, but you don't have a safe place. So, at least for now, you're going to stay here. I'm really sorry.

(...)

Please, don't cry, love. Please... everytime I see you sad like this my heart hurts. I don't want to see you cry, please.

You must hate me right now. But it's ok. I'm doing this for you, I'll keep you safe. You'll understand soon enough.

(...)

You're afraid for your family? Oh, i see. If you don't go back, they could hurt the people you love and care about.

Don't worry your pretty smart head about this! I have some of my men protecting your family 24/7, and they are very capable, if I say so myself. As I said, I prepared everything to help you.

(...)

Oh, thank God! You seem to be feeling better now. Thank you for calming down, my love.

Let me dry your tears.

How are you feeling? Is your body less heavy now? Can you try and move your hands for me?

(...)

Good, good! As I expected, nothing can stop you for long. Not even a super technologic sleeping smoke. [Speaker laughs lightly]

Gosh, I'm so proud of you. You're admirable.

(...)

Yes, of course I love you! I have loved you for years and I'll keep on loving you until I'm nothing but an old forgotten pile of bones. That's how much I love you. Till the end of times, till I...

(...)

Ok, ok, I'll stop! You're so cute when you blush!

(...)

[Speaker gasps]

You... you want me to lay down on the bed with you? Really? Oh, my Goddess, thank you so much!

[Bedsheet noises as the speaker lays down]

Can I do something more for you? Are you hungry? Or uncomfortable in any way? (...)

You feel tired? Well, I'm not surprised, you have gone through a lot lately. The effects of the smoke are wearing down, so you can relax and sleep if that's what you want. When you wake up, you'll be able to feel your full body and move again.

(...)

Of course I can give you headpats! Yes, and kisses too! Come here, I'm gonna cuddle you.

[Headpats sound starts here and can keep going till the end of the video]

[The following phrases can be whispered into the listener ears and the speaker can give the listener kisses between the phrases]

I love you, my darling.

I will protect you.

Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby.

Nothing's gonna take you away from me.

I will be always with you.

My goddess.

My light.

I'll kill them all for you.

They don't deserve to live in the same planet as you.

I'll make them regret what they did to you.

I'll do anything for you.
