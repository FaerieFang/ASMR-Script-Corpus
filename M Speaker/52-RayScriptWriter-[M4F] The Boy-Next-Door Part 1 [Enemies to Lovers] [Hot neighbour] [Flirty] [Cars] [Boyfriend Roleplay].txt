[Door bell SFX]

(Muffled voice) Wait a minute.

(Pause)

I'm coming I'm coming

[Door opens SFX]

Woah- have mercy on my precious ears. Why are you screaming?

(Pause)

Oh fuck. Sorry I forgot to wear my shirt. Wait a second.

(Pause)

Yeah. Hi! How are you and who are you?

(Pause)

Mrs. Altman? Who is that?

(Pause)

Look lady I have no fucking idea who Mrs. Altman is but are those cookies in your hands?

(Pause)

No she doesn't. I live here now(smiling). I'm your new neighbour. Hi.

(Pause)

Wha- Stop smiling? Why?

(Pause)

You know most girls would die for this look of mine, shirtless and smirking. But whatever, your loss.

(Pause)

I'm an asshole? (Scoffs) Then how come you're blushing?

(Pause)

Yes you are. (Cocky) I'm an asshole but I'm a pretty smart asshole, charming too. And this asshole's got eyes. Your cheeks have turned so red, we can use them as fucking traffic lights.

(Pause)

What's my problem? What's YOUR problem? I am literally the most unproblematic person on this earth and the first thing you do when you meet me is try to pick a fight.

(Pause)

Unless.... Girls do this right? They act all rude and mean with guys they find attractive. Now I see what's happening here. Of course you just couldn't resist how good looking I am so to make it easier, instead of seeking me, you're trying to be my enemy.

So? You find me attractive huh? (Smirking)

(Pause)

Hey- Stop hitting me. Girls are gonna get mad at you for ruining my pretty face!

(Pause)

I am unbelievable? Yes I am. I am unbelievably hot.

(Pause)

[Teasing] Aww leaving so soon? Don't you wanna get more acquainted with your new hot, smart and charming as fuck neighbour?

[Listener starts to walk away and towards her apartment]

[Yelling] Hey but this asshole's got a name you know! It's Caleb!

(Pause)

That's a pretty name. Try not to think about me all day. Bye!

[After a few days]

[Door bell rings]

[Door opens SFX]

Hi! It's me. You... don't seem too happy to see me....

Anyways, Umm I'm out of milk and I really need some coffee right now.

(Pause)

So could I borrow some milk from you?

(Pause)

Because I'm lazy okay. It's 8 in the morning. There is no way I'm going out to get milk when I'm this sleepy. Plus I've got such nice, sweet and helpful neighbours. Why would I go out when I can just get it from you?

(Pause)

What am I doing? I'm putting my foot in between so you can't close the door. Now you are going to let me in like a good girl.

(Pause)

Who said I can come in? I did.

Woahh what were you doing exactly? Are those books? Wow, haven't seen those in years. Seriously how do you even look at those things without falling asleep.

What the fuck you've got like a bunch of these. How much does this one weigh? We could use one of these in my gym instead of dumbbells. (Laughing)

(Pause)

Okay so by the look you're giving me I should probably leave as fast as I can. Just give me milk and I'll get going.

(Pause)

Actually....

(Sheepish) Could I also borrow some coffee? And... sugar too? Fine! Fine! Don't yell at me! I forgot to go grocery shopping okay! Could you just make me some coffee here instead? Please? I'll make it up to you.

(Pause)

How? I don't know, you tell me. What do you want?

(Pause)

Answer your questions? That's wierd... but okay. What do you wanna know?

(Pause)

Why am I out all night? Umm- I... I have night shifts at a company. That is why I am out all night. Because of work.

(Pause)

Uh it's not that popular yet. It's just a small start up company. And the investors are from a foreign country so they keep meetings sometimes, that's why we have to work night shifts as well.

(Pause)

My car? It's... not that expensive. It's just a normal car. Anyone could've bought it (nervous laugh)

(Pause)

Wait- you know the name of the model? How? That car is one of a kind! Only 29 of them were ever made. 1955 Schwarz Drei CLS, Gull-wing doors, 2995 cc single overhead camshaft- Fuck. You've found a way to get through me. Why do you keep asking me these questions? Why do you care if my car is expensive or not? Why do you wanna know what I do when I'm out all night?

Wait, how did you know I'm out all night? Are you like... a stalker?

(Pause)

Just curious? (Scoffs) Sounds like stalking to me. By the way, you didn't answer my question. How did you know the name of the model?

(Pause)

Holy fuck what? You're studying to become a mechanical engineer? Damn that's... Interesting. That explains all those thick bunch of books on your dining table.

So, you live here alone? All by yourself? Don't you get lonely?

(Pause)

I know I live alone too. But I've got my reasons. What are yours?

[Listener pours the coffee in a mug and tosses it to you]

Oh thanks. So, you were saying...

[You listen to her telling about her future plans, while sipping on your coffee]

Ohh wow, you've got your whole life planned on a map huh? Living away from home for college, doing jobs even when you have rich parents, preparing for masters in a different country. Does it even go according to your plans?

(Pause)

So far it has? That's nice. Let's see if it still goes the same way.... (Smirking) Now that I'm here.

Shut up don't get all worked up now, I was kidding.

(Pause)

My parents? What about them?

(Pause)

I don't have any parents.

(Pause)

No. I used to live in foster homes. They kept hoping to find a family who would adopt me but by that time I was already 18 and had already lived in 4 foster homes. All of which didn't really give a fuck about me.

(Pause)

No don't be sorry. I don't really care anymore. I'm just happy I'm free now. Free to do whatever I want, whoever I want to meet, wherever I wanna go.

(Pause)

Tonight? No I won't be home. Why?

(Pause)

A potluck? With the neighbours? You really think I would be willing to come to one of those. You don't know anything about me, do you?

(Pause)

I'm not being mean, I just have a race- A MEETING! I have a meeting at 2 am with one of our investors. So no, I can't come for the potluck. I wouldn't have come even if I wasn't busy. Way too cringey for me.

(Pause)

Calm down foxy, I'm not obligated to do any of that okay. I pay my rent, I've done my part as a resident of this building.

(Pause)

By the way, thanks for the coffee. I appreciate it. I'll leave now.

[Footsteps start]

[You give the listener a small smile and walk towards the door before she calls out to you and stops you.]

[Footsteps stop]

[Door opens SFX]

Yeah? What is it?

(Pause)

Tone it down a little? What do you mean?

(Pause)

(Embarassed) Oh... last night. You heard that? (Chuckles) I'm not surprised. We didn't even try to be quiet.

(Pause)

I can't help you with that foxy. You're just going to have to get used to it. And to correct you, that wasn't my girlfriend. Just a random girl who wanted to have some fun.

(Pause)

I know I'm a jerk. But that still doesn't stop girls from drawing towards me. So guess who wins in the end?

That's right. Have fun at the potluck foxy. Don't miss me too much.
