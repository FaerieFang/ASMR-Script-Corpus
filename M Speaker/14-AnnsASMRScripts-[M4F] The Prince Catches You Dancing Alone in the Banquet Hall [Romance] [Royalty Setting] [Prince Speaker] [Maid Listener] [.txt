* It's dark in the castle as Narrator makes his way through the corridors. He's making an effort to lower his steps and cause as little noise as possible while heading to his chambers following an attempted all-nighter to finish his tasks. *

(Internally) Ugh, I have honestly no idea how my brothers are even having a proper sleep schedule at this point. One task, only a single paper, and I'm up for hours. It's already completely dark outside. I can only imagine how much they must have on their plates. Being much closer to inheriting the throne and all. (He groans quietly) No, brain, not now. This is not the time to be thinking about my rather useless position in this household. Thank you.

* As he passes by the door to the banquet hall, the sound of rhythmic tapping reaches his ears. Soon following is humming as quiet as a whisper. He stops. *

(Internally) Huh? Steps? And humming? Is somebody cleaning the banquet hall? At this hour?

* He steps closer to the room, doors slightly ajar. Without touching them, he peaks through the opening. *

(Internally) Let me take a quick look ... Just a little bit of curiosity ... Hold on ... Is that ... Is that somebody ... dancing?

* Inside the room is a girl, the Listener, that he can barely see. Only the moonlight is outlining her shadow as she dances across the room, lost in her own thoughts. *

(Whispering) Wow.

* He finds himself being drawn to watching her a little more. *

(Internally) I can barely see her. There's so little I can make out. Only her shadow floating from one spot the other. Twirling, and twirling, and twirling. Do I know her? I wonder if I do. What could it be that she is doing here? All on her own and humming along to her own melody ever-so-peacefully. If only girls like her where in attendance at the official banquets. Humming with her every step and just drawing me in. (He chuckles.)

(Internally) What a stupid thing to think. She might as well be an intruder, waiting for her chance to attack. (You can tell that he isn't serious) So, I might as well watch her a little more. For safety reasons, of course.

* He sneaks through the door, leaning against the wall right next to the entrance. It doesn't take long until he has lost track of time, his initial excuse to watch her being long forgotten as well. *

(Internally, focused) It's still impossible to make out her features, even from inside the room. Her hair color, her face, everything. I wonder ... How many times has she danced here before? All by herself, without me noticing? There's not much you can do alone in this huge room. But there she is, not caring about the emptiness around her. (Pause) I should go. I really should. I bet she didn't intend for anyone to see her here. A pity. I wish I could have stayed just a minute longer. (He sighs audibly) 

* He freezes when he realizes what he has done. Only the sound of breaths filling the room, he looks at the girl who has stopped dancing all together, staring back at him from the middle of the room. *

(Aloud, but only to himself) Oh- Oh no- (He clears his throat) Uhm, please apologize my sudden intrusion. I didn't mean to scare you.

(Internally) I shall be damned. It's still too dark for me to see her face but I can tell that she is frightened. Eyeing me like a deer waiting to be attacked. I didn't mean to cause her such distress. I should have just left her alone. In her tiny bubble of happiness.

(Aloud) Please allow me to step a little closer. You will see that I'm not someone you need to be afraid of. (He raises his hands a little and chuckles rather shakily.) See, my hands? I come in peace and mean no harm.

* Slowly, he takes some steps towards the girl who remains glued to the middle of the hall. The closer he gets, the more does the moonlight reveal her features. *

I was only passing by when I heard you humming, you know? It was rather captivating, I must admit that. But I really didn't come to pry on you or anything. (His breath hitches once he fully gets to see her face, but he catches himself.) Finally, I get to see who charmed me this quickly. (He smirks)

* He watches the eyes of the girl widen in shock as she realizes who is standing in front of her. She falls to the floor, kneeling in front of him like everyone working at the place is customed to doing. *

(Soft, a hint of pain in his voice) Please, rise to your feet again. I was the one interrupting you, there's no need for such formalities. I'm sorry for making you do this. My uniform isn't making it easier, right? (He chuckles desperately) That's better. Don't feel afraid to look at me. Here, take my hand. I'll help you up.

* He extends his hand, carefully offering his strength to help the girl back to her feet. *

There we go. Speaking of formalities, let me stick to the protocol now as well. Since we are officially meeting for the first time. 

* He places his right hand in front of his heart and slightly bows in front of the girl. *

(Serious, official tone) I'm [Name], third prince of [Country's Name], third-oldest child to the king and queen and therefore third in line to the throne. It's a pleasure to be meeting you. May I ask for your name, too?

* She tells him her name. *

What a unique name. I promise I won't forget it anytime soon. Now, how are you associated with this castle? Are you a guest of ours that I had yet to meet?

* She tells him that she is working for the first princess, his sister. *

(Soft and curious) A maid? For my sister? That might explain why I haven't seen you around before. You are mostly working in her chambers, is that correct? Ah, then it does make sense. She is not much of a fan of her brothers coming to visit her and entering her room. (He chuckles) I swear we are not that bad. Just a little loud when we all come together. 

* The girl chuckles as well, being quick to cover her smile behind her hand before it fades again. *

(Internally, in awe) Ah, she chuckled. The way she scrunched her nose. To die for. Wait, what?

(Aloud, stumbling over his words after being lost in thought) What? She complains about us leaving behind a mess every time we visit? (Jokingly) Oh, come on, that's not true. I'm sure you know that, too! But it sounds like you are getting along well, I'm glad to hear that. There's hardly enough time to get to know every single person working here. And that's a real pity.

(Pause)

Huh? My sister is treating you well, you say? Not that I was expecting anything else, but it still comes as a relief. She's a kind soul. But that also means that you are doing your job well and I want to thank you for that. Getting up in the early morning hours to help us with our duties and only going to bed after we do, it's not the most enjoyable lifestyle either.

And nevertheless, you stay up at night, twirling through the banquet hall at 2 in the morning. I wonder why that might be. (curious, intrigued)

* Hesitating at first, the girl explains her reasons for secretly spending time there. *

You ... You want to feel like royalty? (Hurriedly) No, please, don't feel embarrassed about that! (He pauses and exhales softly) You really must have been working hard for all your life to feel this way. I don't want to pretend that I fully understand that because I never had to worry about food, shelter and health. But I really do understand the appeal big empty rooms have at night. They are so quiet; it feels like you can fill them with your dreams all the way to the top and not a single soul in the world would care. 

Do you do that every night? Walking through the halls, pretending to be someone you are not to escape reality for a moment?

* She explains it a little more. *

So, it's the banquet hall that draws you in every now and then. The room with the huge windows lining the wall all the way from top to bottom. And a shimmering chandelier hanging from the ceiling. A room with so much space and unlimited opportunities to use it. Hm, I don't think I've ever thought about it this way. For me, it's always connected to having to interact with guests that also have authority over us. Or hold power. It's always about impressions and pretending. And frankly, I'm not the best at socializing. (He chuckles in defeat) 

* She joins the conversation again. *

Fair enough, there's a big difference between attending a ball as a prince and dancing here alone at midnight in your paja- Wait. (Confusion and shock) Did you say pajamas? 

* He immediately slaps his hand in front of his eyes, avoiding eye contact with her and turning his head a little to the side. *

(Nervous) Oh, oh heavens, I'm sorry, I really didn't notice! Iâ€™m already looking away! (He starts rambling) No wait, it's not like I was looking at your clothes or your body for that matter. I mean, I was watching you earlier, but not like that, uhm, I just thought you were really endearing dancing through the room in your little bubble of happiness, and uhm, and yes, I couldn't stop watching, but that's not what I wanted to say, it's ... it's just that I wasn't looking at you that way. If I made you uncomfortable, I'm terribly sorry. I didn't want to. I'm just ... I'm just ...

(Internally) Completely stupid and ruining every chance for a casual conversation with her that I might have had in this life. 

* Her, chuckling: Really bad at socialising? *

(He sighs.) Yeah, I'm just really bad at socialising. You got that right. Okay, how do we go about this? It's autumn, how are you not freezing? A nightgown has such little fabric! (He swallows when he realizes what he just said.) Uhm. Let's not talk about that. At least you are wearing your slippers. How about ... Oh, I've got an idea! 

* With his eyes closed shut he removes his cape from his uniform, a long and soft row of fabric, definitely enough to keep her warm. *

I'm not looking, I promise!

Here, take this. Don't worry about returning it, I'll just tell my sister and ask for her help. Like I said, she's actually a kind soul. But you know that, of course. It might be a cape, but if you use it like a blanket and wrap it around yourself, it should keep you warm.

* He watches as she wraps herself in the luxurious fabric. *

Exactly, just like that. Turn once more and it's wrapped all around you. (He chuckles) Yup, nearly there. (Pause as he watches her) So cute. (Sudden inhale) I-I mean, good. So good. Because that's some splendid fabric. Isn't it? (Nervous laughter)

* She thanks him for the cape *

(Pause) You are very welcome. Again, I'm sorry for interrupting your private time like this. I just couldn't stop myself from watching. Never ever had I see something or rather someone like you before. So, I also must thank you for letting me enter your dream bubble. 

(Pause)

What? Oh, don't worry. I will keep all this a secret, our little secret if you may. Just make sure to get back to your room safely, alright? My sister would have my head if she knew that I made you stay up all night.

(Pause)

How about I accompany you to the stairs? 

* She asks what major events could happen if she were to go alone. *

(He chuckles) Of course, you are right. I'm sure you would find the way just fine on your own. But please grant me that one minute to walk with you, will you? 

* She accepts. *

(Delighted) Great! Perfect, thank you. So, (He clears his throat) My Lady, (He smiles.) How about you take my hand, and we walk off into the night? Just the two of us?
