 “Hm? What is it?….What?(chuckle) Really? You don’t know how to roast marshmallows?” 

 “(sigh) That’s what you get if you keep looking at your  phone all day”

 “It’s simple…Poke a marshmallow onto a stick”

 “Then, just  roast it, just above the fire…Or if you're bold, like me. Toast it...”

 “You do that until. Boom. Golden…”

 “I know you’re not my partner, but Just stay (short pause) You heard me, just stay (whisper) Don't make me say it again”

 “(slight commanding/shy  tone) Give me your  hand…”

 “(SFX: Tent zipper open) Be careful, alright? (SFX: Tent zipper closes)....I only have one sleeping bag, will that be okay?” 

 “(SFX: Two people getting in a sleeping bag)...Is it comfy?....Hey, put your head on the pillow….Yeah, it’s okay…I..I don’t mind….And we’re closer than before (awkward silence)”
 
 : “Um hey. Im -  I’m really sorry about earlier….All the things i said…I'm really sorry (short pause)”

 “Hm?..(sigh) I’m not mad at you…(shy tone) I..I- I just don’t know how to act around you”

 “(Short pause) Do you remember our first camping trip, when we were kids?” 

 “I was so excited that day, but my parents had to cancel it all of a sudden…” 

 “It didn't stop us though. We did the whole thing in my backyard. We  built our own little tent. Ate smores. Stargazed….” 

 “After that night, all I ever think about is how can I get back to you” 

 “You're the only person I feel safe with…You're the only one who can make me happy…You  can even see the good in me when I can’t…”

 “I wanted to be like you….I wanted to make you smile, make you laugh. I wanted you to know that you’re not alone. That there’s someone you can open up to, cause I know you have a hard time trusting people…”

 “I wanted you to feel loved as well, that there's someone who cares about you. I want to show you that….You, matter to me....”

 "But you left before I can do anything. (short pause) and when You came back” 

 “I tried everything to push you away”

 “(short pause) (shy tone) But I keep returning  to you….because, I..I.. I still love you”

 “(sigh)You heard me…I, I  like you…”

 “(shy tone) And I’m serious!...This isn’t some stupid prank” 

 “I know I’m bad for you…But, I want to be with you so bad,  but  I’m afraid it wouldn’t work between us”

 “...We’re so different from each other….I bullied you alot, called you names….I’m nothing compared to you”

 “You’re still nice...Still patient, and you’re still forgiving...So why would you want to fall in love with me?”

 “(short pause) (soft chuckle) You really didn’t change, huh?” You still see that better version of myself….”

 “Maybe I do need you....I promise to be better….I want to do those things  that I should have a long time ago….Because you deserve it”

 “(short pause) Hey, close your eyes for me?…Do you trust me?....(kisses) (Kisses)....” 

 “Did you like that? (giggle)…You’re mine now, you got that? (chuckle) (shy tone) You’re my baby now” 

 “I’m never gonna hurt you again, and no one will ever hurt you, I  won’t let them….” 

 “I am serious (chuckle)...I know how to fight (chuckle) I’ll fight what’s mine…and I’m not gonna share(chuckle) You’re mine, and this lips are only for myself (chuckle)” 

 “Alright, alright….You’re still gonna be my partner tomorrow, right?”
