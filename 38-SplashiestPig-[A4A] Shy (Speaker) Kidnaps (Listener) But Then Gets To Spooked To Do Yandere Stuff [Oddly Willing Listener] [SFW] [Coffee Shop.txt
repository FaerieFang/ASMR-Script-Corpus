Hey, gorgeous, you’re looking…

(quick exhale)

Hey… honey, I…

*small pause*

No, that’s still not right! Come on, |Speaker’s Name|! We’ve got this. Focus!

*small pause*

Hello my… pet..? No, that’s stupid! I had this all planned out, why does it sound so dumb now?

(sigh)

Maybe I should just-

[listener thrashes]

(yelp)

You’re awake! And I was… practicing at the mirror… I…

*small pause*

I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to mess up our introduction like this.

*small pause*

Please stop struggling! You look angry. And I didn’t tie those ropes very well. I-

[listener thrashes]

Don’t struggle more! I… I don’t want you to go yet! Please! Give me ten minutes! Just a bit to explain myself, and I’ll let you go!

*listener stops*

Thank you! I promise you won’t regret this! Here! Let me cut the ropes right now! To prove I’ll let you leave when all of this is over!

[ropes snip]

There! You’re free! Well, you were always free. I could never have actually kept you here against your will. I… I love you too much.

*listener questions*

Yes, love. I know, it’s a dumb way to show it. I… I should start from the beginning.

*small pause*

I see you in the morning every day. We both grab coffee at the same time. When I first saw you, I was blown away! You looked amazing and at like, six in the morning no less! Every morning, I had a pep in my step because I knew I’d get to see my coffee shop crush!

*small pause*

I… I guess I knew that’s all we’d ever be. One-sided pining and oblivious existence. I didn’t mind it too much. I was fine with just getting to see you. But… well… all of this started because I told one of my friends about you. She’s… she is… well, there’s no nice way to say this… she’s the Moonlight Killer.

*listener starts*

Don’t panic! The news doesn’t have the whole story! She doesn’t kill ~all~ her victims!

{quietly}

Just, most of them.

(clear throat)

She fell in love with a vampire. She has them locked up in her basement, and she kidnaps people to feed her love. And well… we’ve been friends since birth, so… I still hang out with her.

*small pause*

Anyway um… I told her about my crush, you, and she suggested that I just kidnapped you! I told her I couldn’t do that, but, she always talked about it, and about how happy her and her vampire were, and how well it worked, and…

*small pause*

Well, she wore me down. I knew I wouldn’t catch your attention naturally, and I don’t have that je ne sais quoi to approach someone as hot as you, so… it kind of felt like my only option.

*small pause*

So… she loaned me some pills. She actually tried to give me a bunch of stuff but, a lot of it was extremely violent so I turned her down. I took the pills and just, slipped them all in your coffee one day. Turns out, if you drag a well-dressed, unconscious body to your car, no one cares as long as you say, “Their blood sugar is too low”.

*small pause*

I drove you back here to my, “basement”. Although, it is just the guest bathroom with the windows covered. My friend said the basement detail was important so I tried to re-create it the best I could but, my apartment only has one level. It’s the thought that counts, right?

*listener responds*

So um… yeah… Wow, did it suddenly get hot in here, or are you just staring at me?

*listener speaks*

I… uh… Do you… what do you think about all that?

*listener states*

Thanks, I put a lot of time into hiding the sink! But um… that’s not really what I meant.

*listener agrees*

You’re uh… you’re standing up. Are you leaving now, because, I wouldn’t blame you! I can lead you to the door if…

[dull thud]

(yelp)

Why did you pin me?

*listener deflects*

Do I like it? Well, I… you’re definitely very strong and… I already told you you’re attractive and… you’re breathing down my neck so…

(whine)

*listener speaks*

{high-pitched}

Yes, I-!

(clear throat)

Yes, I um… I like it.

*small pause*

A little bit.

*pause*

So… does that mean you’re not mad anymore? About the kidnapping thing?

*listener speaks*

Well um… that’s good! That’s great! So, does that mean I’ll hear from you again? After I let you go?

*listener confirms*

Phone numbers? Yeah, that’s smart! Here, what’s your number?

*listener states*

And… send! There! That text is me. |Speaker’s Name|.

*pause*

So um… I… I had a plan for a second step if this one went okay. Well, it wasn’t much of a plan, more like a request.

*listener questions*

Now um… I don’t know you very well, so I don’t know how you might react to this but… I… I… have a hard time falling asleep.

*listener asks*

No, that’s not the weird thing. I… I have a lot of stuff that helps me sleep but um… they’re all basically just different ways to simulate falling asleep next to someone else.

*listener questions*

Yeah, I’ve got a pillow with a heartbeat, and heater, a cloth sleeve thing that grips me, you know, all the stuff a human would do if… if I was dating someone.

*small pause*

I’m not asking you to fall asleep next to me! That’d be really forward when we barely even know each other’s names! But um… I was kind of hoping to ask you for something that’s arguably, more creepy.

*small pause*

This is a… video camera. And… I wanted you to um… Set it up on your bed so I could… watch you sleep.

*listener looks*

It’s the only weird thing I want to do! I promise! After this, it can be normal meet-ups or dates or whatever you want! I just… I’d really like to see you more. And you can stay in front of a camera pretty easily when you sleep and it’ll help me fall asleep too so it’s two birds, one stone and I thought that maybe you’d… say yes?

*listener agrees*

You’ll do it for a kiss? I… um… yes! Yes, please! Are you going to lean down or should I-

(kiss interrupts)

That was… amazing! You… You’ve been really forward, and not at all like what she said a kidnapped person is like! I… I think I need to go lay down!

*small pause*

Um… the front door is right this way. I think it’s time I let you go but… I’ll see you tomorrow, right? Over coffee? And I can text if I want to see you before then!

*listener agrees*

I… Thanks! I’m glad you took this well. I’ll uh… see you tomorrow, I guess.

*listener speaks*

I love you too?!
