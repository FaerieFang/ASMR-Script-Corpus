* It's dark in the castle as Narrator makes his way through the corridors. He's making an effort to lower his steps and cause as little noise as possible while heading to his chambers following an attempted all-nighter to finish his tasks. *
(Internally)
* As he passes by the door to the banquet hall, the sound of rhythmic tapping reaches his ears. Soon following is humming as quiet as a whisper. He stops. *
(Internally)
* He steps closer to the room, doors slightly ajar. Without touching them, he peaks through the opening. *
(Internally)
* Inside the room is a girl, the Listener, that he can barely see. Only the moonlight is outlining her shadow as she dances across the room, lost in her own thoughts. *
(Whispering)
* He finds himself being drawn to watching her a little more. *
(Internally)
(Internally)
* He sneaks through the door, leaning against the wall right next to the entrance. It doesn't take long until he has lost track of time, his initial excuse to watch her being long forgotten as well. *
(Internally, focused)
* He freezes when he realizes what he has done. Only the sound of breaths filling the room, he looks at the girl who has stopped dancing all together, staring back at him from the middle of the room. *
(Aloud, but only to himself)
(Internally)
(Aloud)
* Slowly, he takes some steps towards the girl who remains glued to the middle of the hall. The closer he gets, the more does the moonlight reveal her features. *
* He watches the eyes of the girl widen in shock as she realizes who is standing in front of her. She falls to the floor, kneeling in front of him like everyone working at the place is customed to doing. *
(Soft, a hint of pain in his voice)
* He extends his hand, carefully offering his strength to help the girl back to her feet. *
* He places his right hand in front of his heart and slightly bows in front of the girl. *
(Serious, official tone)
* She tells him her name. *
* She tells him that she is working for the first princess, his sister. *
(Soft and curious)
* The girl chuckles as well, being quick to cover her smile behind her hand before it fades again. *
(Internally, in awe)
(Aloud, stumbling over his words after being lost in thought)
(Pause)
* Hesitating at first, the girl explains her reasons for secretly spending time there. *
* She explains it a little more. *
* She joins the conversation again. *
* He immediately slaps his hand in front of his eyes, avoiding eye contact with her and turning his head a little to the side. *
(Nervous)
(Internally)
* Her, chuckling: Really bad at socialising? *
(He sighs.)
* With his eyes closed shut he removes his cape from his uniform, a long and soft row of fabric, definitely enough to keep her warm. *
* He watches as she wraps herself in the luxurious fabric. *
* She thanks him for the cape *

*Confused, Listener asks if she knows him.*
*Slightly bashful*
*Listener, starting to feel uneasy, takes a step back.*
*Narrator sighs, clearly starting to feel embarrassed.*
*Hesitant*
(Pause)
*Listener asks Narrator what he wants to talk about.*
*Listener tells Narrator that she’s not going anywhere until he explains what he needs to talk about.*
*Growing more nervous*
*Listener refuses unil Narrator explains why they need to talk to her.*
*Still nervous, but growing a bit frustrated.*
*Listener turns begin to walk away.*
*Narrator catches up to Listener in a few quick steps.*
*Listener stands still, albeit reluctantly, as Narrator lets out a tense sigh.*
(Pause)
*Leaning down to whisper in Listener’s ear*
*Surprised, Listener takes a stumbling step backwards as Narrator makes an embarrassed noise.*
*Flustered*
*Confused and intrigued, Listener agrees and walks through the busy, talkative crowd with Narrator, going to the aforementioned hallway. This offshooting hallway next to the locker room is much quieter than the one they had been in. Only two pairs of footsteps can be heard in the otherwise empty hall. Narrator sighs when they finally come to a stop further down the hall where no prying eyes can see them.*
*Bashful*
*Listener bluntly asks Narrator what he meant when he said that he wants Listener to ‘ruin him.’*
(Pause)
*Sheepish, apologetic*
*Listener gives Narrator a deadpan look, saying nothing.*
*A brief awkward silence follows before Narrator before he clears his throat.*
*Listener remarks that they don’t know everything, they have probably acquired enough knowledge about so many things that it seems like they know everything, but they have probably have a select few fields in which their interest has brought them more extensive knowledge. They list a few examples about their own interests and the research they’ve done into them. Narrator sighs dreamily.*
(Pause)
*Narrator laughs softly, still bashful.*
*Voice quieter now, almost whispering*
*Listener asks him to explain.*
*Listener, surprised, needs a minute to take in what Narrator has said before asking Narrator to elaborate.*
*Narrator laughs, amused by his own corny pick up line. Listener bluntly asks him why he wants her to ‘ruin him.’*
*There’s a long pause as Listener processes everything.*
*Listener cuts Narrator off, telling him that she needs more time to think.*
*Understanding, reassuring*
*Listener is silent as she thinks. Narrator starts to hum a nonsensical but cheerful tune to pass the time.*
*Puppy-like excitement*
*Listener cuts Narrator off mid-sentence by putting her hands on his shoulders and quickly pushing him against the wall behind him. Narrator gasps, but quickly ends up laughing in surprised excitement.*
*With no other words, Listener leans forward and presses her lips against Narrator’s. She isn’t rough or aggressive, but she is assertive, hands holding Narrator in place as she moves her lips against his. Narrator happily complies with Listener’s kiss, following her movements. When they pull away, Narrator laughs, giddy.*
(Short Pause)
*Listener responds positively to the statement before kissing Narrator again, her hands sliding down to his chest while still keeping him pressed against the wall. The first kiss turns into making out, occasionally breaking for a breath before kissing again. After several kisses, Listener asks a breathless Narrator if this is what he had in mind when he said he wanted Listener to ‘ruin him.’*
*Breathless*
*Before Narrator even gets a chance to finish his question, Listener is kissing him again. They kiss several more times before pulling away.*
*Slightly out of breath, but very happy*
*Listener responds that yes, she’ll go on a date with Narrator.*
*Listener laughs, telling him that she thought his begging was cute.*
(Pause)
*Listener (more or less gently)
*Breathless*
*Narrator laughs as he sheepishly runs a hand through his hair.*
*Listener responds that it does.*
*Listener gives Narrator a final quick kiss before telling Narrator that she needs to go to her next class but she’ll see him again later.*
