[Late night ambiance]

[the sounds of something crashing through the bushes]

“Ugh! Son of a– Die already!”

[the sound of metal clashing with metal]

“What kind of vampire is this?! Much more powerful than I expected, and it doesn’t even seem sentient- augh!”

[he gets slammed into the ground]

[sounds of a struggle]

“Hey- g-get off me! Gh- I-I can’t-!”

“Aw sh*t sh*t sh*t– I gotta think of something… I can’t get to my weapons while I’m holding off this thing– they can’t even be reasoned with, these vampires!”

“Get… Off me!!!!”

[you burst through the underbrush, tackling the other vampire off of him.]

“Gah!”

[the other vampire runs away through the woods, leaving the two of you alone.]

“Hahh… hahh… th-thank you… I– I thought I was gonna–”

[pause]

“... You.”

“What are you doing here?!”

[pause]

“Well I got some reports of abnormally strong vampires gathering in the area, so I came over to check it out. As far as I’m concerned one of yours is responsible, and you being here doesn’t really help your case.”

[pause]

“Wha– I’m not injured!”

[pause]

“Well clearly your sense of smell has gone bad, because whatever blood you smell isn’t mine!”

[longer pause]

“.... ugh… okay, fine. Yes, I’m injured from the earlier fight, but what are you going to do about it? Try to take me down? Right here? It isn’t so bad that I can’t fight!”

[pause]

“Okay yes it’s bleeding a lot, but as long as I put pressure on it, I’ll be fine. I can still take you on!”

[pause]

“... Huh? You’re injured too?”

[pause]

“You fought one of those vampires too?”

“But aren’t they your kind? Shouldn’t you be… working together or something?”

“And how do I know you aren’t lying to me?!”

[pause]

“Oh. Oh wow. I… I don’t think I’ve ever seen a wound that big on you… and I’ve been trying to hunt you down for years.”

[pause]

“Yeah… I guess I know your methods well enough to know you wouldn’t do something so stupid to try and get close to me.”

[pause]

“Ugh, fine. Neither of us are in the best condition to fight right now. So… I guess we can call it a… temporary truce.”

“But if those vampires aren’t your… underlings, and you aren’t why they’re gathering here, then why were you here in the first place?”

“And why did you save me? Wouldn’t it have been convenient for you if I’d been killed by that thing?”

[pause]

“... No one gets to kill me except you?”

[he laughs]

“Ah… to think that I turned down help from my fellow hunters because of the exact same reason…”

[long pause]

“So… you’re saying these vampires have been affected by a… mysterious virus?”

“They’ve all gone… feral? Attacking anything that moves?”

[pause]

“Man… I can see why you’d want to stop them now.”

“Then why are you here of all places?”

[pause]

“So you got the same intel as I did.”

[pause]

“Ugh… it looks like this situation is bigger than the Hunter’s Guild thought…”

[pause]

“Huh? H-Hey, what’s going on?! Are you okay?”

[Pause]

“Oh don’t pull that crap now! Like I said, I’m gonna be the one who takes you down in a fair fight, not some– not some other vampire! So you’d better not die, you hear me?!”

“Oh god that looks really bad– uh– does human medicine work on vampires?”

“No, they have the opposite effect, dammit I should have remembered that! I’ve been hunting you for years!”

[pause]

“H-Hey, don’t pass out on me now!”

“I still– I still need to– I still need to use you in order to get these aggressive vampires under control! Th-That’s it! And don’t forget that I still have to be the one to finally take you down!”

“Think, think! Agh, I’ve never helped a vampire before, I don’t know how to! They didn’t cover this during training!”

[pause]

“M-My blood?!”

[pause]

“Hey! N-No way I’m falling for that! Y-you’re just gonna drain me if I let you f-feed from me!”

[pause]

“You… you don’t have to drink from my neck?”

[pause]

“... Oh… I was so panicked that I forgot about my own wound…”

[pause]

“Wh- I– I wasn’t scared for you!”

[pause]

“Okay, okay. I– I’ll remove my hand… and you can… lick the blood off of my hand.”

“But I swear, if you try anything… I still have access to my knife.”

[pause]

“Again, I want to kill you in a fair fight. And you’re clearly weakened.”

“It wouldn’t be right for me to stab you in the back right now.”

[pause]

“Okay… I’m– I’m taking my hand off my wound.”

[rustle]

“Ugh… god that hurts…”

[he offers his hand to you]

“Both my hands are gonna be covered in blood now, so hurry up.”

[long pause as you lap up some of his blood. Your wounds heal quickly]

“Whoa… I know I’ve seen vampires heal before, but I didn’t know that just a little blood in your system would remedy a wound that severe so quickly…”

[pause]

“S-Sweet?! M–My blood tastes sweet to you?!”

[pause]

“I-I’m not blushing! I’m only doing this so… so that you owe me one!”

[pause]

“Working together… I guess since this is a problem affecting both of us, we’ll have to…”

“You have intel that I need, and I have intel you need.”

“Just this once… I suppose we can put our differences aside.”

[pause]

“Done? Finally. Ugh…”

[pause]

“O-Of course I find you vile. You’re a vampire after all.”

[pause]

“Again, I’m not blushing! How could I be while I’m bleeding so much?!”

[short pause]

“Oh, I’m still bleeding.”

[pause]

“H-Hey, don’t laugh like that!”

[pause]

“What do you mean you’ll help me?! I can take care of my own wounds just fine!”

[pause]

“Returning the favor?! B-But-! How will I know that you won’t kill me?!”

[pause]

“W-well… I guess I did help you… but still. I don’t want you touching me!”

[pause]

“... You actually backed off?”

[pause]

“O-Oh right! Okay, okay. I’ll treat my own wounds.”

[you stand up]

“Huh? Where are you going?”

[pause]

“Standing guard in case other vampires smell the blood? … And also to give me some privacy?”

[pause]

“Um… thanks, I guess.”

[pause]

“Okay, I’ll call you when I’m done. Now go stand guard like you said you were going to!”

[sound of leaves rustling as you head through the foliage]

“Ugh… this is all making my head spin…”

“... Blushing? For a vampire? What a joke…”
