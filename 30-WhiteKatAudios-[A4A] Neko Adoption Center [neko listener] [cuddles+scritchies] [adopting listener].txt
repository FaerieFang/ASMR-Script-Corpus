Hey, I'm here to see-- yea, I'm here to see [him/her/them]. theylaughsthey Do I come here that often?

theydoor open SFXthey Hey there, I'm back! Didja miss me?
 
Hey, hey, hey, yes I have treats, but you need to say hi first!
 
Thank you. Now, how are you doing? Have you been a good [boy/girl/kitten] for me?
 
That's good to hear; now, before I give you your treats, did you eat all of your lunch today?
 
Even the vegetables?
 
Are you lying to me?
 
theysighthey You know sweetie you aren't going to grow up big and strong if you don't eat your vegetables.
 
Yea, I know they're yucky, but you have to be good and eat them even when I'm not there to watch over you. 
 
You don't have to apologize for that; what I would like an apology for is lying. Do you remember what I said about lying?
 
That's right; I'm more upset about the lying than whatever you did wrong. Now, since you didn't eat your vegetables at lunch, will you promise me that you'll eat an extra helping at dinnertime?
 
That's a good [boy/girl/kitten]. Here. [hands listener the treats]
 
Hey, hey! Slow down! You're gonna choke!
 
That's it, small bites. It'll last longer.
 
[sits down next to listener] You know I've missed you this week. It's been... oh it's been quite the week.
 
Well, my boss hasn't been the best at fixing the issues I keep bringing up to him. It's frustrating seeing problems occur that I theyknowthey are going to happen because theysomeonethey doesn't think they're that big of a deal.
 
theylaughsthey Yea, he needs to use his listening ears, just like you do! [ruffles listeners ears] theyscritching SFXthey
 
You're always so soft and fluffy, you know that? Been keeping yourself well-groomed. 
 
You know, you've improved a lot since I first met you. I remember you being so skittish, you had mats in your fur, you looked just... you looked like you needed someone to love you. 
 
Yea, and then you met me! How long has it been? It feels like forever.
 
A month? Wow, time really flies doesn't it? 
 
So how have you actually been? I know you said you're doing okay, but I've heard that before. How are you theyreallythey doing? The other kittens aren't bullying you, are they?
 
Honey, you're shrinking up again. Are you being bullied?
 
You know I can tell when you're lying to me, don't you? I won't get mad with you if you say yes.
 
theysighthey I'm going to have to have a word with the staff on my way out. That is simply not acceptable. How could anyone bully such a precious [boy/girl/thing] like you?
 
You do theynotthey deserve it. Who told you that? Is it the same neko who's been giving you trouble the past couple of weeks?
 
God, someone needs to discipline that one. They can't just keep getting away with it! No one has the right to do that to theyanyonethey.
 
"You took care of it"? ... theysighthey What did you do?
 
theysighthey Honey, you theyknowthey it isn't okay to bite other nekos. 
 
Yes, even if they call you mean names. You have to tell an adult!
 
Okay, I theydidthey say that it was good that you were getting more independent, but I didn't mean that you should retaliate so aggressively!
 
theysighthey You're a little troublemaker, aren't you? Such a rascal.
 
Oh, you aren't? Then what are you?
 
You're my good [boy/girl/kitten]? theysighthey I can't say no to that face. Come here.
 
theyscritching SFXthey
 
You really are my good [boy/girl/kitten], aren't you? 
 
You know, it's been so nice getting to know you the past few weeks, I was wondering if... maybe you'd like to come home with me?
 
If you're not ready to leave I'm okay with that, I'm more than happy to keep visiting you here at the shelter.
 
You-- you want to come home with me? Really? Oh, that makes me so happy! Let me go tell the staff and then we can collect your things, okay sweetie? See you in a bit!
