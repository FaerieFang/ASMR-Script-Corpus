[Mutters] “So…the total energy within a substance, the internal energy, is the total kinetic energy of the particles and the potential energy between-”

[Notices listener nodding off] “Hey! Are you falling asleep again?” [laughs] “Haha…this is like what, the fifth time this hour?”

[Pause]

“Get up you lazy bum. What time did you even sleep last night?”

[Pause]

“Wow and I thought I had a messed up sleep schedule. You were up watching YouTube videos again, weren’t you? What do you even watch or listen to, so late at night anyways?”

[Sigh] “Nevermind…I don’t even want to know. I’ve explained thermal physics to you, repeatedly, for the past 30 minutes and you haven’t even written a single word down on that worksheet.”

[Pause]

“Yawning while I’m talking? Hey, look at me. In the eyes.”

“Yes, in the eyes. … Ah, so you are awake. Good.”

[Gets closer, teasing whisper tone] “I could print more worksheets for you if you’d like…”

[Pause]

“Ah, that’s what I thought. Do you want to move on? We could work on the engineering physics unit next.”

[Pause]

[Chuckle] “Seriously? Oh, so now you want to move on to English literature? This morning we started with English, then we did math, chemistry, physics, and now English again?”

[In disbelief] “And I told you, you shouldn’t have picked your classes based on the person you found cute a month prior to the opening of school. Do you still like them, that person?”

[Pause]

“What does the silence even mean? We’ve been friends for like forever. I can’t believe you never told me who it is or at least showed me a picture of what they look like. I’m starting to believe this person doesn’t exist and you’re just bad at choosing what subjects you’re going to take. Oh well, at least you have me in all of those classes.”

[Pause]

“Yes! Be grateful. Remember our last math test? If I didn’t call you that morning, you would’ve slept in until lunch. Bet.” [chuckles]

[Longer pause]

[Sounds apologetic] “I don’t mean it like that. You know I don’t mean it like that…Hey, believe in yourself more. I know you did your best. You studied really hard for that test. I saw you. I can guarantee a hundred percent, you won’t fail.”

[Pats head of listener] “I know you feel better when I pat your head like this…mhm. Yes, I’m being honest. You worked really hard and you probably overslept because you were worrying so much about failing. Really, you’re smarter than you think you are. Don’t put yourself down so much. If it means anything, I believe in you. And if you need any help, I’ll be here for you. Always.”

[Pause, listener makes a joke]

[lightens up] “Yes…I canceled a study session on you last minute, but that was once! Once! It won’t happen again for sure. I couldn’t help it. You know how my body acts up under stress. Yes, I’m taking better care of myself now, but as should you.”

[Longer pause]

“Okay, okay. You’re distracting me again. Let’s get back to English. So, tell me, what is the author trying to imply about the character at the first stanza of this poem?”

[Pause]

[Teasing tone] “We’ve gone over this~”

“The love interest. The author used this metaphor to compare the characters’ feelings to that of the main lead’s. A beautiful mask. They feel the same way, but one of them is actively trying to conceal their emotions. They don’t want to give the other character false hope.”

[Pause]

“Oh, what do I think? Well…I guess it’s kind of touching? Personally, I wish they are more straightforward with how they both feel. Haha…could save a lot of pages. But I understand why they would feel the need to try to hide them.”

[Pause]

“You agree with the main lead? Interesting…”

[Pause]

“Hey! Despite how you see me constantly studying, I do know a thing or two about romance.”

[Pause]

“Yeah I do. I-I mean I haven’t had as much experience as you…in the dating scene, but you tell me things. I’ve heard around.” [Lowers voice] “Felt things…thought of it…”

[Flustered] “H-have I thought about it? Like making up romantic scenarios? To fall asleep?” [Nervous laughter] “Ahaha…well…we are humans after all. I’m sure you do it as well! Don’t deny it.”

[Pause]

[Whisper] “So…out of curiosity, do you think of anyone? Before you sleep…?”

[Pause]

“Oh. That crush…right…So, when are you going to tell me who it is?”

[Pause]

“Actually…it’s alright. Tell me whenever you are ready. I’ll figure it out eventually…” [voice trails off]

[Concerned tone] “Hey, you seem tired. To be honest, we’ve done a lot of studying. Let’s wrap it up for today. Good job for staying awake until now. You should get some rest.”

[Pause]

[lower voice] “I’ll clean up the table. Don’t worry about it.”

[Quiet shuffling noises (optional)]

“Yeah you can rest your head on my shoulder…go ahead.”

[Pause]

“I’m so proud of you, alright? I know studying isn’t for everyone, but seeing you taking the effort to come all this way to study with me at the library, that’s already enough for me. You really deserve some rest.”

“Shh, it’s okay. No one’s watching us. You don’t have to be embarrassed.”

[Pause]

“Yeah just close your eyes. I’ll play with your hair, just a little bit, if you don’t mind.”

[Pause]

“Mhm. I’ll wake you up later. Just sleep for now.”

[Pause]

[Whispers] “Sleep well, my precious…”
