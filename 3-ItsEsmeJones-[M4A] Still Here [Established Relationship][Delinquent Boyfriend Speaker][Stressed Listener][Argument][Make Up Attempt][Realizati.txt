[Scene opens within an office, late at night]

[SFX: Frustrated typing and a cell phone going off]

[Pause???]

“Heeyyyy, baby. It’s your favorite bad boy.”

[Pause]

“Oof, someone’s in a mood. Having a rough day at work?”

[Pause]

“You’re STILL there?! It’s nearly midnight, you’ve been working since 8 AM!”

[Pause!]

“OK, OK, sorry… I, uh, might be about to make things worse…”

[...]

“Yeeeah, I’m kind of being held at the police station for taking a swing at Jake. In my defense, before you get super mad, the asshole made a comment about you that I didn’t appreciate. So, uh, yeah. If you could come pick up your super handsome, muscly boyfriend, that’d be super.”

[...]

“Aw, c’mon, baby… It’s not like I’m trying to drive you up the wall, I’m just… you know, me.”

[SFX: Keys jingling]

“Thanks, baaabe, love yooouuu.”

**[Scene transitions to the police station]**

[You arrive at the police station after thirty minutes or so and give the clerk an apologetic shrug]

“Aw, cmon, Ross! That toothpick was the only thing keeping me entertained!”

[Pause]

“Fine, fine, we’re getting. Geeze, everyone’s in a bad mood tonight. There’s my baby! Mwah, hey sweet thing. Uh-? OK, I’m backing off, sorry. Yeah, have a good night, Ross. Try not to be too cheerful, yeah?”

[The two of you walk outside as your boyfriend chuckles. He sticks another toothpick in his mouth with a wince and a chuckle]

[Pause…]

“Course I had another toothpick, sweetie. Rrgh, but chewing on it hurts like crazy… Guess the fucker did get in a good hit or two, eh? Hehe. Good thing we have that bag of frozen peas.”

[Pause]

“...You OK, Hon?”

[Pause]

“You sure as shit don’t sound “fine”. You look like you took as many hits as I did but don’t have the marks to show for it. What’s going on?”

[Pause]

[He scoffs, pulling away]“Well pardon the fuck out of me! Geeze, what’s got you so riled up? This isn’t my first overnight in the slammer, it probably won’t be my last.”

[Pause!]

“That’s…the problem? What? You’re the one that was all hot and bothered for the “delinquent”, sweetheart, I don’t know what the fuck you expected.”

[He puts on a slightly mocking tone]

“Ooh, I bet I can ‘fix’ him and he’ll be oh so thankful that a goodhearted little thing like me came along and will totally validate my desire to feel needed!”

[SFX: The Listener stopping dead]

“...I-I… fuck, baby, I’m sorry, that was…”

[Pause]

“Don’t talk to you? OK, you know what? Fine. I’m going to go do the “delinquent” thing and get a drink at the bar. You go do the goody-two-shoes thing and go be a productive member of society.”

[He storms off, leaving you to your own devices]

[Scene transitions to your apartment, several hours later]

[SFX: The door opens and the Speaker trudges in]

“Baby…? Baby, are you here?”

[SFX: A bouquet rustling]

“...OK. If you are here and just don’t want to talk, that’s fine, I get it. I was a dick. I, uh… I brought you some roses. They’re 24-hour grocery store roses, but… I didn’t want to come home emptyhanded, you know?”

[Pause]

“Damn… I wonder if they fell asleep already? Kind of hope so… They’ve been having a lot of trouble sleeping lately. Wait… is that…because of me? No, I… I’m not that loud at night. I’ve gone out way less. That’s…that’s enough, right?”

[SFX: Footsteps and a door quietly opening]

“Ah, man, they are asleep… Poor baby. I’m gonna sit on the bed, OK? Please don’t punch me if you’re pretending to be asleep… What am I saying, you’ve never punched me… I appreciate it, you know? I’m so used to getting beaten up that I forget… that you’re always gentle with me…”

[He sighs and sets the bouquet aside, lying down with you]

“I’ll take you yelling at me if I can just lie here next to you… You know, it’s so dumb. I always feel like I have to be this person just to keep you around. I’ve got my job at the car shop, sure, but… fuck, what else could you possibly see in me? I drive you crazy, and it used to make you smile, but lately…”

[Again, he sighs, and pulls you close]

“I wish you’d talk to me, baby… You used to open up to me about everything, but now… Oh, honey, you only get this way when you’re really stressed… God, and I made it a thousand times worse just from running my stupid mouth earlier. You didn’t deserve that… You came straight from your crazy fucking job just to bail me out because I just HAD to swing at a guy that talked shit about you… W-What…what do you even see in me? I’m… I’m making you miserable, aren’t I…?”

[Pause]

“I’m glad you’re sleeping at least. You’re not even…snoring…this…time…”

[He sits up, alarmed]

“Baby?! Baby! Oh god, you’re barely breathing! Shit, shit shit shit, FUCK! H-Hang on, I’m calling someone right now!”

[SFX: Him dialing emergency services and generally panicking]

“H-Hello?! Y-Yeah, I, I need help! My partner is out cold and barely breathing!”

[Pause]

“I don’t know! I just got home and they were in bed a-and… oh god… oh no, t-there’s a pill bottle here for one of their medications a-and it’s empty. It was full this morning! Oh my god, oh baby, no, no no no, not like this!”

[Pause]

“I-I, a-ah… they have a pulse b-but it’s weak! The address is 1024 54th Ave S, please hurry!”

[...Pause…?]

“BABY! H-Hey, hey… there you are! No no no, don’t-! Don’t you leave me, do you understand?! Help is on the way, I promise, s-so just-!”

[Pause]

“W-What? N-No, don’t apologize! It’s OK, it’s going to be OK… Hey! HEY!”

[You consciousness begins to slip again. Bile is in the back of your throat as you watch your boyfriend’s face fade away above you]

“Please hurry! Please please, oh god, I-I think they’re dying! Baby, hang on, OK?! HANG ON!”

[You slip away]
