[The villain hurriedly makes their way towards the room the hero is being held in. The door opens and the villain comes stumbling in, heaving breaths, and trying to get their breath back. They didn't want to leave the hero waiting too long. After all, they could easily leave if they really wanted to.]

Just... just give me moment, please.

{They continue to pant, before letting out a long sigh, and collecting themselves.}

(excitedly) So!

Welcome to my new lair! Do you like it? I’m personally a big fan of the colossal dark marble pillars myself. Feels so... fancy.

...

Well yes, of course I splurged on it. I knew that at some point they’d probably get crushed, and why not make it an aesthetically pleasing destruction? Can you really blame me, hero?

...

What do you mean ‘what have I been doing?’ I’ve been trying to beat you, and it seems I’ve succeeded.

...

Well, yes, I know you walked in here on your own accord, but that’s besides the point. Now you’re tied up with no way out, so I can finally talk to you.

...

I’d tell you if you would just let me monologue! You’re not normally this rude, you know. In fact, that’s exactly what I wanted to talk to you about.

...

{scoff} Not just you being rude, thank you very much. I’m talking about the lack of passion, the failing justice that so many have called unfailing. Is this because of my little stunt as an anti-hero?

...

What? You don’t remember that? Not the whole ‘steal from the rich’ scheme I had back in May?

Really? I had a new costume for that and everything.

(mumbling sadly under their breath, though clearly audible) Of course, you probably didn’t notice...

...

Yes! The one with the blue accents! See, you do remember!

...

Well, I mean, if you really liked it that much, I suppose I could always give it another shot...

Mike, could you go get that one for me? Leave it in my office. I don’t really feel like going to the basement right now...

...

Then get someone who does have clearance to do it. Thank you.

I’m getting off track. You’re good at doing that Hero, you know, throwing me off my train of thought. What was I talking about?

...

Right! The anti-hero stunt!

Honestly, I wouldn’t blame you if that’s why you’ve been a bit more... withdrawn lately. It really did not suit me.

Aside from the costume, I don’t think I was really cut out for being an anti-hero. For starters, I’m not actually anti-hero. I like heroes. Well, heroes plural might be a bit generous. I like a hero.

...

Wha- I’m- I’m talking about you, you idiot. What other hero do you see me graciously allowing into my lair? I even set those guard dogs on you. I know how much you like petting them. The way you light up when you see them, grinning even in the most serious situation, cooing at them with that adorable voice...

But, once again, that is not the point!

You’ve been acting odd the last couple of months. Don’t think I haven’t noticed the way you’ve been going solo more often than not. You haven’t been in the past 5 group photos of that little team you’re part of. You didn’t even show up to my robbery of that bank last week.

...

(slowly, as though wary of saying the wrong thing) You... didn’t see the point?

...

I know they’re corrupt as all hell, that’s why I did it.

...

You agreed with me. You. The hero. Agreed with me.

Are you okay? Are you sick? Did that idiotic buffoon of a scientist try to kill you with some sort of strange poison again?

...

No? Hm. Well, I’m officially going insane. I knew it would happen at some point. I mean, it’s basically the villain pipeline. You go from being a regular every day person to having one defining moment where you decide you’ve had enough, screw around with some ridiculous evil schemes for a while and then at some point you go insane.

...

Oh haha. Sure. I’m (mockingly mimicking the hero’s tone) already insane.

{scoffs} You’re being a little shit. Don’t get me wrong, it’s kind of cute, but it’s also a bit concerning. What happened to that TV persona you always put on?

...

No, I’m not filming. Why would I do that?

...

Just because I streamed it live once, doesn’t mean I’ll do it again. You made a complete ass out of me last time, it’s never going to happen now. That’s never stopped you from being the physical embodiment of the boy scout spirit.

...

And... now you’re giving me nothing.

Are you... okay?

You know what, no, you’re very obviously not.

Fuck it. I’m letting you out. Come on.

[The villain lets the hero out of the chains/rope they were tied up in and helps pull them up.]

Okay, we’re going to the kitchen because you look two seconds away from a breakdown and I’d rather you be at least somewhat comfortable. And I can make you something to eat, considering how insane your metabolism is. There’s absolutely no way you aren’t hungry after that fight.

[The two walk from the villain’s interrogation room to a cosier area, and towards the kitchen.]

Now, you sit down, relax, and talk to me while I get some ingredients out, okay?

[As the hero sits down at the kitchen bench, the villain rifles through the cupboards for ingredients.]

I’ll make some pasta. Don’t worry, I know your dietary restrictions and all that. I even know the diet the super hero council has you on.

Frankly though, it seems somewhat ridiculous, and unless you personally tell me not to, I will elect to ignore it.

...

Good. Now talk. What is going on with you?

... [Listener asks if they’ve thought about giving up the whole villain thing]

Hm. Well, I guess I have considered stopping... It’s hard not to have second thoughts sometimes when you commit to something this extreme. Why do you ask? Are you-

...

You what?

...

What do you mean, you ‘don’t want to be a hero anymore?’ Was it something I did?

...

No? Then-

...

{Sigh} The council. Those bastards. They’ve been getting into your head, have they?

...

Well, whatever they say, they’re not worth it. You’re a perfectly capable hero. You have the least casualties per fight of all the heroes in the country, and that’s a statistic, not just my opinion.

...

They... don’t care... about casualties. What.

...

Are you sure they’re heroes?

...

I see. So that’s why you’re having doubts. Could you not, I don’t know, leave the council? Do your own thing?

...

Oh ew. No, you’re right. You’re absolutely right. If I can’t be an anti-hero, then you certainly can’t be either. You might be able to pull off the costume, but not the dynamic. I can’t fight an anti-hero. It’s too moody.

...

{Laughs} Well, I’m glad you feel the same about me.

You really don’t want to do the hero thing anymore, do you?

Hm. I have to admit, I haven’t been feeling the drive to fight anymore either. I’ve mostly just been doing it for a chance to see you again recently.

But... if you’re just going to wander in here and sit at my counter whilst I cook for you, keeping half the city hostage seems a bit... unnecessary.

...

Now that is a question, isn’t it? Would I still be a villain if you weren’t a hero? Two sides of the same coin. What happens when one leaves?

I suppose... I suppose I wouldn’t. There would be no point. Any other hero wouldn’t treat me seriously, and they certainly wouldn’t be as fun to fight or banter with. In fact, I had been looking at passing on the organisation to this little upstart over by the river.

...

Yes, that little group that have been dubbed modern day Robin Hood and his Merry Men. Even if I can’t be an anti-hero myself, I can certainly support others who can. How to go about it though...

...

Faking our deaths? Isn’t that a little... cliche?

...

(amused, but genuinely excited) Oh you want to make a spectacle out of it now do you? Have a fight in the middle of the city, perfectly choreographed?

...

Oooooh, that is a great idea! Make it look like we destroyed each other! Good!

I can make that work, can’t I? Make it look believable? After all, people really thought I hospitalised you that week in April last year when you went on that vacation. There were letters and gifts and everything. Maybe we could convince people to donate to charity with that effort instead, go out with a bang!

...

Of course I’m willing to help you! Why on Earth would I not?

...

Hate you? No! Didn’t I just say a few minutes ago that I like you? I enjoy our time together, you idiot. If you’re going down, I’m going down with you.

...

That’s not how the saying goes? Well, that’s how it goes for me.

Could you hand me the- Yeah, thanks.

Idiotic saying or not, I’m with you, alright? We’ll fake our deaths and go to New Zealand or something. Heroes and Villains never show up there.

...

Oh, this lair isn’t all that precious to me. I may have been lying about the pillars. I’m pretty sure I got scammed which is kind of pathetic, but as I said, I’m somewhat loosing my touch.

The architect just seemed happy to have a chance to let loose and I couldn’t really say no with how proud he looked. Hopefully the next owners will deal with it so I don’t have to feel bad.

...

I am not a softie!

...

Well, maybe I am! But you’re more of a little shit than you let on, so you have no firm ground to stand on.

...

(spluttering) I do not get flushed when you tease me! Not only are you a little shit but you’re a liar too, hmph.

...

Fuck it. Fine. I’m a big softie, you happy?

...

I- I haven’t heard you laugh like that in a while. It’s... nice.

...

Right! The sauce! Let me just put all of this together and leave it to sit on the stove for a bit.

[The villain puts a pan on the stove, turns it on, and starts putting in ingredients.]

There we go.

(muttering under their breath) That needs to go for 10 minutes with intermittent stirring...

...

What? No... I didn’t memorise your favourite pasta recipe, what are you talking about, hahaha...

...

(hopeful) You memorised that brownie recipe I talked about? Huh. Have you tried them?

...

Ha! I told you they were good!

...

Well maybe I can make some to celebrate once we’re both legally dead, hm?

Does that sound alright to you? Sit on a rooftop somewhere, eating brownies whilst the city is in chaos over the death of both their most persistent villain and their beloved hero? Equal parts relief and sorrow. That seems fitting, doesn’t it?

...

[The hero stands up and starts making their way to the cupboards.]

What are you-

[The hero grabs cutlery and starts to set the table.]

Oh, thank you. You didn’t have to set the table.

...

Well if you’re feeling that awkward about not helping out, you can grate some of the Parmesan whilst I give this a stir.

{villain sniffs the air}

On second thought, no. You are going to go have a shower. I’m sorry, but you stink.

...

You went through the sewers? EW! Go! Shower, now!

...

You can just borrow some of my clothes.

...

Excuse me, I do so have comfortable clothes! Believe it or not, my entire wardrobe isn’t just dark leather and spandex. Hmph.

Head to the first door on the left down the hall to the master bedroom. May as well use the en suite if you’re there. Pick whatever you want from my closet. Dinner should be ready by the time you’re done.

...

Yes, yes, whatever, you don’t have to thank me. Think of it as payback for throwing you into that building last week. Now, shoo.

[there’s a pause as the hero walks away and the villain continues to cook]

(affectionately) Idiot.

(mimicking the hero) *‘I thought you hated me.’ *

What a load of rubbish. Guess it’s up to me to look after the dumbass.
