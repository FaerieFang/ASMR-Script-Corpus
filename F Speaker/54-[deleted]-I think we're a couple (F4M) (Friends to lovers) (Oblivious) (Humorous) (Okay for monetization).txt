 Can you believe the nerve of that waitress? I told her that we're just friends and she actually laughed. And she kept looking at me in this knowing way, like she knew my feelings better than I do.

...

 Can't a guy and a girl just be friends these days? Why does everyone assume we're dating? I mean sure, we spend a lot of time together, but that's natural, we've been friends since like, the first grade. That doesn't mean we're in love.

...

 Exactly! I'm so tired of having to explain to everyone why we're not a couple. Couples do all kinds of things together that we don't.

...

 Yeah. Like flirting. Couples flirt with each other and I don't.... Okay, well, I don't flirt with you that often.

...

 What's that supposed to mean? I-it's just, remember that time we went on a "not-date" for Valentine's Day? We did kind of flirt with each other then. B-but only for fun! We were hamming it up as a joke, that's all. *Nervous laugh*

...

 True. I guess we've kind of kept doing it since then. But not like, seriously, right? Oh not that I don't actually think you're handsome or anything! I do, ah, in a platonic way of course!

...

 Alright, so we do flirt. But that can't mean... Oh I know. Couples kiss! We don't do that. Sure I peck you on the cheek sometimes, but those don't count. They're not like, real kisses or anything. ... W-why do you not look convinced?

...

 The Christmas party? Oh yeah we did kiss then, didn't we? Stupid Danni and her stupid mistletoe. Whatever that was just some freak thing. Not that it wasn't enjoyable or anything but, ah, in a platonic way...

...

 What do you mean that wasn't the only time? Wait are you talking about that one time in High School? That was just some dumb teenage dare, that's all. Same with that time at the party or the other time at movie night!

...

 Okay so I guess we do kiss a little more than your average best friends. But that just shows how comfortable we are with each other. We can kiss and it's totally platonic!

...

 What else do couples do? They cuddle right? I know we do that too, but only when you make me watch scary movies. At least at first, now I do it because it's just so comfortable.

...

 Do I cuddle with any of my other friends? Well, no. But I'm not as close with them.

...

 I know! Couples go on dates and, sure we do a lot of the things couples do on dates. but we don't call them that.

...

 It is not bad logic!

...

 Prom? Okay, yeah you took me to prom, and homecoming. But those don't count, they were friend dates, not date dates.

...

 *Sighs* I know I just contradicted myself, didn't I? Wait I got it! Couples celebrate their anniversaries, and we don't have an anniversary!

...

 A friendship anniversary is not the same thing! I bet a ton of best friends go on a d- err, I mean hang out, on the day they met. *Awkward laugh*

...

 We hold hands too, but that doesn't count. At least it shouldn't.

...

 No, I don't know of any other best friends who go to fancy restaurants together, all alone. But that doesn't mean it doesn't happen!

...

 *Laughs* We're freaking out over nothing. Relationships aren't about the actions you take, it's about what you feel. That's why we're not a couple, it isn't about not kissing, it's about how we feel about each other.

...

 And how do I feel about you? Well I think you're funny, thoughtful, and kind. I feel happy and strong whenever I'm around you, and whenever we've been away from each other for too long, I start to miss you. I even remember getting a little jealous the last couple times you dated. And honestly, I think it's because I can't picture my life without you in it...

...

 ... Hey, so. Don't panic. But I think we're a couple.
