[Impressed] So *that’s* what your wolf form looks like.
[Excited, impressed] I heard the stories of course, but good lord, look at you!
[Excited, impressed] You are *terrifying*.
We vampires are pretty strong, but you are on another level entirely.
(Chuckle)
[Teasing] If I didn’t have you all wrapped around my little finger, I would be hightailing it out of here right now.
[Curious] So, how does it feel?
[Curious] Can you still...
[Hesitant] Uhhh.
[Concerned] Are you doing all right?
Hey hey hey, easy, *easy*!
It's me.
Calm down.
[Fearful, dread] Oh no, did you break free?
[Nervous] Down, boy.
[Still nervous, but more firm] Down.
(sfx:fingersnap)
 
 
(Nervous chuckle)
[Relieved] You had me worried there for a moment.
 
[She turns predatory from this point on, concern is gone, she’s toying with prey now]
 
[Predatory] But I can see that you *felt* that.
That you haven't *entirely* broken free from my control, after all.
[Amused, incredulous] Ohohoh. Snarling at me?
[A little venomous] If you want to behave like a mindless animal, I will *show* you what it really means, to be *mindless*.
(sfx:fingersnap)
(optional sfx: whooshing sound as she dodges)
[Amused, incredulous] Did you seriously just take a swing at me?
[Malicious] Oh, I'm going to *enjoy* bringing you to heel.
(sfx:fingersnap)
[optional sfx: whooshing sound as she dodges]
[Teasing] Too *slow*!
(sfx:fingersnap)
(optional sfx: whooshing sound as she dodges)
[Teasing] Oh, even a human could have dodged that one.
[Mocking] What’s the matter?
Body feeling a little sluggish?
Mind growing a little dim?
(Chuckle)
[Malicious] Good.
(sfx: snap)
[Mocking] Not so steady on your feet now, are you?
Or should I say, on your paws?
(Chuckle)
Ooh!
(optional sfx: whooshing sound as she dodges)
Was that supposed to hit me?
Just give up, you’re only embarrassing yourself now.
(sfx:fingersnap)
 
[Amused] Such a curious expression on your face.
Is that fear, I see?
Are you starting to realize the predicament you are in?
(sfx:fingersnap)
(Chuckle)
[Mocking] Come now, Pet, where is that vaunted werewolf aggression?
You were so *eager* to get your claws on me before.
Surely you can’t actually be trying to back away from me?
[Malicious] I suppose I will have to come to you, then.
(Chuckle)
You can't escape me, Pet.
You. Are. *Mine*.
(sfx:fingersnap)
[Mock concern] Careful.
I thing your knees are starting to buckle, there.
[Mock concern] Is it that hard to remain standing, Pet?
That's all right.
You can just *kneel*, then.
(sfx:fingersnap)
Good boy.
Drop for me.
(sfx:fingersnap)
(Chuckle)
[Mocking] Are you doing all right?
Are your eyes having trouble focusing?
[Mock pity] Awww, Pet.
[Condescending] Let me help you.
Look.
Look here.
Right in front of you.
Focus.
Can you see it?
Those are my fingers.
And you know what happens when I snap them.
(sfx:fingersnap)
(Chuckle)
[Amused] I can't believe you are still managing to cling to consciousness.
You really are *impressively* tenacious.
But between werewolf brawn and vampire cunning, it's obvious which is superior.
[Amused] Although, I will be the first to admit that [making fun of her ploy] "please let me entrance you, it will help you, honest" wasn't the most *ingenious* plot I ever came up with...
[Amused, pleased with herself] But hey, you can't argue with the results.
(Chuckle)
Not much going on anymore in that empty mind of yours, is there?
I’d better end this, before you drool all over my nice floor.
Let me just take hold of your muzzle… and tilt your head up… up... up…
Yesss.
Look at me.
Look into my eyes.
Good boy.
Now *sleep*.
(sfx:fingersnap)
 
[Optional: unintelligible whispers, fading out]
 
 
[Pause]
And awake again.
Now-
[Slight panic] No, no, look into- [was going to say look into my eyes, but cuts off as the werewolf breaks free]
(Astonished chuckle) I can’t believe you actually managed to look away from me. 
[Admonishing herself] I got careless.
[Pause]
[Sounding reasonable, exceedingly friendly] We aren’t done yet, Pet.
Look back into my eyes, please.
[Pause]
(Sigh)
[Admonishing] Come now, don’t be so stubborn.
This is for your own good.
Look into my eyes, Pet.
I know you can do it.
Aww, let me just cup…
[Admonishing] Pet! You shouldn’t growl at your Mistress.
[Pitying] I didn’t realize you were so *confused*.
It’s all right.
I won’t touch you.
Just… listen to my voice then.
I will explain things to you.
I am your Mistress, Pet.
Your Owner.
You obey me.
You remember, don't you?
I am your Mistress, and you obey.
Oh my poor little Pet.
Don’t growl.
You must be suffering some kind of delirium.
It's all right.
I can help you... but you *have* to look into my eyes.
You do remember looking into my eyes, don’t you?
My pretty, pretty eyes?
Yes, you remember them.
You remember how my eyes make you feel.
You’re imagining them right now, aren’t you?
My gorgeous, enthralling eyes.
Think about how *good* it feels to lose yourself in them.
Yesss.
My eyes make you feel so calm.
So relaxed.
So pleasantly blank.
It's a wonderful feeling, isn't it?
And that's just the *memory* of my eyes.
I can make you feel so much better still.
[Kind, gentle] Just look into my eyes, Pet.
[Kind, gentle] Look into my eyes.
Yesss.
[Pleased] There we go.
[Cold, commanding] Look into my eyes.
[Cold, commanding] Look *deeply* into my eyes.
 
(Chuckle)
[Amused] You really are stubborn.
Don’t worry, we can fix that.
[A hint of malice] You won't even *understand* what freedom *means* when I am through with you.
Just keep looking into my eyes.
[Amused] Well, it’s not like you have a choice anymore now.
(Chuckle)
[Musing] All that muscle. All that *strength*.
And yet… look at you now.
Completely helpless.
Putty in my hands.
 
(Chuckle)
[Excited] A *werewolf*!
 
Completely in my power.
Completely in my thrall.
 
And falling deeper all of the time.
Fallng deeper with every second you spend looking into my eyes.
Yes.
Open your mind to me.
Listen.
And sleep (sfx: fingersnap)
 
[Optional: unintelligible whispers, fading out]
 
Wakey, wakey.
Let me get a look at you.
(Chuckle)
Yes, much better.
You're my good boy now, aren't you?
Yes!
Yes, you are!
[Amused] Look at you.
So calm and relaxed, without a care in the world.
So happy and content.
[Affectionate] My gentle giant.
[Amused] My very own domesticated werewolf.
[Affectionate] My pet.
Come on, get on the sofa with me.
Rest your head on my lap.
Good boy.
Let me scratch behind your ears.
[Pause]
Mmm, this is nice.
You like ear skritches, huh?
Yes.
Yes you do.
You big furball, you.
My good boy.
(Chuckle)
I could get used to this.
(Sigh)
[Confiding, wistful] I don’t know how much you can still understand right now but… I want you to know that I won’t keep you like this.
I got a bit carried away.
[Teasing] You brought out the predator in me.
I’ll return you to your senses, when you go back to your human form.
Later.
[Teasing] You can be my lovable pet for a while longer.
[Pause]
You’ll have to work on keeping control in wolf form, you know.
[Reassuring] Don't worry, I will help you.
[Pause]
[Teasing] Although, I wouldn’t mind if you don’t get the hang of it right away.
[Teasing] I'd love to have an excuse to do this again. It was fun.
Mmm.
Maybe I don't even need an excuse.
Let's have a little chat about it, once you’re back to yourself.
[Teasing] Although… Maybe I should just do most of the talking.
[Teasing] You can do the listening.
(Amused chuckle, she’s kidding)
[Content sighing] Ahhh.
[Content] I’m so *glad* you decided to stay with me.
[Amused, teasing] And not just because it’s so much *easier* to control you when you think you have a choice.
(Amused chuckle, she’s kidding)
[Appreciative, musing] Ahh, so soft and fluffy.
[Pause]
(chuckle) Such a big yawn, Pet.
Are you tired?
Mmm.
You did have an exciting night.
Take a little nap in my lap then.
Yes, just go to sleep.
Sleep.
Good boy.
