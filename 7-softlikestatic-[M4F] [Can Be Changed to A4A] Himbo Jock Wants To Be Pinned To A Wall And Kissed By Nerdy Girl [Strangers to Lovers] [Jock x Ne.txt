*The sounds of people talking and walking through the hallways are all around Listener as she exits the lecture hall. Just as she begins to walk down the hallway, a man steps up next to her, clearing his throat.*

“Excuse me, hi. Sorry to bother you but I uh… I wanted to ask you something, I guess?”

*Confused, Listener asks if she knows him.*

*Slightly bashful* “Uh, no, I don’t think you know me. I mean, we’re in the same dorm and had a humanities class together last semester, but I don’t think we’ve actually interacted beyond a few seconds of eye contact.”

*Listener, starting to feel uneasy, takes a step back.*

“Wait, sorry, I know that sounds weird. God, I’m terrible at things like this.”

*Narrator sighs, clearly starting to feel embarrassed.*

*Hesitant* “I… Uh… There was something I wanted to talk to you about, I guess? Shit, there’s really no good way to say this. Could we maybe talk about this somewhere else? Somewhere we aren’t surrounded by people?”

(Pause)

“I promise it’s nothing weird or creepy. At least, it’s nothing creepy. Despite the way I felt the need to clarify that I’m not being creepy.”

*Listener asks Narrator what he wants to talk about.*

“Um… I can’t really say it right here. That’s why I’m asking you if we can go somewhere more private.”

*Listener tells Narrator that she’s not going anywhere until he explains what he needs to talk about.*

*Growing more nervous* “Listen, I really can’t tell you right now, but I promise I’ll explain if we just go somewhere else. Please, can we just go like, anywhere else? What about the hallway right over here, beside the locker rooms?

*Listener refuses unil Narrator explains why they need to talk to her.*

*Still nervous, but growing a bit frustrated.* “I-I just told you, I can’t tell you right here. There’s too many people here for-”

*Listener turns begin to walk away.*

“Shit, wait! Wait, please!”

*Narrator catches up to Listener in a few quick steps.*

“Fine, I’ll explain here, just… Stand still so I can tell you.”

*Listener stands still, albeit reluctantly, as Narrator lets out a tense sigh.*

“Just… please don’t… get mad at me, okay? I’m really not trying to be creepy or an asshole, I swear.”

(Pause)

*Leaning down to whisper in Listener’s ear* “Okay, so the reason I need to talk to you is… Oh god I can’t believe I’m actually telling you this but… I need you to take control and make a mess of me. Like, really ruin me.”

*Surprised, Listener takes a stumbling step backwards as Narrator makes an embarrassed noise.*

*Flustered* “I-I mean, not in that way! We just met and I definitely don’t expect you to just, y’know…! I just meant, uh… Oh, god, everyone is looking at us now. Can we please go somewhere else now?”

*Confused and intrigued, Listener agrees and walks through the busy, talkative crowd with Narrator, going to the aforementioned hallway. This offshooting hallway next to the locker room is much quieter than the one they had been in. Only two pairs of footsteps can be heard in the otherwise empty hall. Narrator sighs when they finally come to a stop further down the hall where no prying eyes can see them.*

*Bashful* "Thanks for coming with me. It's just so awkward to talk about things like that when we're around so many people and there's a chance that they can all hear us."

*Listener bluntly asks Narrator what he meant when he said that he wants Listener to ‘ruin him.’*

“Oh, yeah, I guess I should probably explain what I meant back there, shouldn’t I?”

(Pause)

*Sheepish, apologetic* “Yeah, ‘obviously,’ I know. I’m sorry about that, but you said you wouldn’t come with me unless I told you why I needed to talk to you! So I told you, but, like I was saying, it’s something that we would be better off talking about in private."

*Listener gives Narrator a deadpan look, saying nothing.*

"Right, I should start explaining myself, shouldn't I?"

*A brief awkward silence follows before Narrator before he clears his throat.*

"I have a thing for nerdy girls. I just think they're really cute and sweet, but also determined and smart. Like, they're so passionate about what they like, and they can give you whiplash when they talk about even the simplest things. They just know so much about everything, and I think that's really hot.”

*Listener remarks that they don’t know everything, they have probably acquired enough knowledge about so many things that it seems like they know everything, but they have probably have a select few fields in which their interest has brought them more extensive knowledge. They list a few examples about their own interests and the research they’ve done into them. Narrator sighs dreamily.*

“Yes, exactly like that! See, that kind of thing is super hot to me. The way you just find something you want to know and keep learning about it until you’re satisfied. I just really admire that."

(Pause)

"Yeah, really. It's just… I dunno, something about how invested nerdy girls get into their work, it's so cool. Like, you know, that whole 'it's about drive, it's about power' mindset. It's so impressive to see how much they focus on something. The sheer amount of attention they can devote to what they're doing is stunning."

*Narrator laughs softly, still bashful.*

*Voice quieter now, almost whispering* "If I'm honest, I always wanted to be the center of that kind of focus. I think it would be intimidating, but also really exciting. And that's partially why I'm talking to you right now."

*Listener asks him to explain.*

"Well, I wanted to talk to you because… Because I just can't take it anymore! I want to have a nerdy girl make me all weak in the knees and get me to blush, and you're the perfect candidate. You're my dream girl."

*Listener, surprised, needs a minute to take in what Narrator has said before asking Narrator to elaborate.*

“Why you? There’s a lot of reasons you’re exactly who I’m looking for. You’re really smart and clever. Listening to you talk is absolutely mesmerizing, I could do it all day. You’re absolutely adorable, especially when you’re focused. Or when you’re angry. Or whenever you’re passionate about something really. But speaking of you being angry, you have quite the temper on you, too. I find it pretty attractive, actually. Your personality is just so - how do I even describe it? Fun? Fascinating? Bright? Ooh, yeah, bright! You’ve got a really bright personality, and let me just say, I’m like a moth for bright, pretty girls like you!”

*Narrator laughs, amused by his own corny pick up line. Listener bluntly asks him why he wants her to ‘ruin him.’*

“Oh right! So basically, the reason I want you to kiss me senseless is because, to put it simply, I can’t stop thinking about you. You have that lecture class three times a week, right? Monday, Wednesday, Friday, every week. And every week, you sit in the same spot in that lecture hall. Well, you know there’s one wall of that classroom that’s just glass? That wall actually faces the gym that’s connected to the locker rooms right behind us. I wasn’t sure if you even noticed that, given how you actually pay attention to that class, but since the gym has glass walls, too. From some spots, you can even see into the gym, and I can see into the classroom.”

“So usually, when I’m doing certain workouts, I can see you while I do them. And I’m only human, so when I see a really pretty girl who looks like she’s my type, I can’t help but keep looking. Especially when I keep seeing that same pretty girl in that same class every time I’m in the gym. I figured that, eventually, I’d be able to quit thinking about you while I work out and actually get my head back into it. But as time passed, I just kept looking at you more, and I realized that I just couldn’t stop thinking about you at all. You were just so magnetic, and I couldn't get you out of my head."

"Of course, I started having little daydreams about you. Talking to you in the halls, asking you to help me with my homework, holding your hand while we study together… The more I thought about you, the more romantic the daydreams got. Then one day, I thought about what it would be like if we kissed. I thought about how it would feel to pin you to the wall and make out with you. But I realized pretty quick that I'd honestly like it much better the other way around. After I thought about that, though, it's like it consumed me. All I could think about was you, grabbing me and pushing up against the wall. It didn't matter where; in the library while we were studying, in the elevator back at the dorms, in the locker room after I was changing. I just wanted you, your hands on me as you kissed me until I couldn't breathe. I still want that, honestly. It's like I said, I can't stop thinking about you. I want you to make me weak in the knees and leave me speechless. I want you to look up at me with those pretty eyes and tell me that you’re going to kiss me, and then do it. I want you to kiss me how you want, however you want, and when I’m gasping for breath, I want you to tell me that I’m yours. “

“Like I said, I just can’t get that thought out of my head, and it’s starting to affect everything. My grades were fairly good, but they’re starting to drop and I’m having a hard time pulling them back up. My coworkers keep telling me that I’m zoning out during my shifts. Hell, even when I’m working out now, it’s so hard to focus that I usually have to have someone count my reps so I don’t get confused and have to start over. You’re completely taking over my every thought, and I can't handle it anymore! So I’m here, asking you if you’ll push me up against the wall and kiss me, just this once, so I can get my head back to normal. And that is… Yeah, that’s everything I wanted to tell you.”

*There’s a long pause as Listener processes everything.*

“So… What do you think-?”

*Listener cuts Narrator off, telling him that she needs more time to think.*

*Understanding, reassuring* “More time to think? I totally understand that. Take all the time you need. No pressure.”

*Listener is silent as she thinks. Narrator starts to hum a nonsensical but cheerful tune to pass the time.*

*Puppy-like excitement* “Oh! Did you decide what you want to do? Did you want to kiss me? I mean, you can tell me no, I’m definitely not going to force you into anything. I’m not that kind of guy, I swear. My first impression was weird to say the least, so I wouldn’t blame you at all-”

*Listener cuts Narrator off mid-sentence by putting her hands on his shoulders and quickly pushing him against the wall behind him. Narrator gasps, but quickly ends up laughing in surprised excitement.*

“Wait, are- are you going to kiss me right now? Oh my god. Do you want to*?* Kiss me, I mean? Do you really want to kiss me? Because I would absolutely love that. A lot. I would love to kiss you right now.”

*With no other words, Listener leans forward and presses her lips against Narrator’s. She isn’t rough or aggressive, but she is assertive, hands holding Narrator in place as she moves her lips against his. Narrator happily complies with Listener’s kiss, following her movements. When they pull away, Narrator laughs, giddy.*

“Oh, that’s even better than how I thought it would feel! Your lips are so soft and warm. And when you did that little thing where you like, bit my lip- Hot damn, that felt good. What flavor of lip gloss are you wearing? It tasted different, I don’t think I’ve ever tried that kind before.”

(Short Pause)

“Lavender? Huh. I didn’t even know they made lip gloss in that flavor. Don’t get me wrong, I like it. It’s unique, and it suits you. Sweet, but strong. It tastes so good on you.”

*Listener responds positively to the statement before kissing Narrator again, her hands sliding down to his chest while still keeping him pressed against the wall. The first kiss turns into making out, occasionally breaking for a breath before kissing again. After several kisses, Listener asks a breathless Narrator if this is what he had in mind when he said he wanted Listener to ‘ruin him.’*

*Breathless* “No- No, this is so much better. Holy hell, I could never have imagined anything feeling this good. Your hands on my chest, how close you’re standing to me, your lips against mine. I didn’t even get close to how amazing this is. You are so much better in real life than my mind could have let me imagine. Could you, you know-”

*Before Narrator even gets a chance to finish his question, Listener is kissing him again. They kiss several more times before pulling away.*

*Slightly out of breath, but very happy* “Hey, so I know I said that I’d just ask you to make out with me this one time, but can I ask you a different question? Because I’d be an absolute idiot if I didn’t shoot my shot and ask you out to dinner right now.”

*Listener responds that yes, she’ll go on a date with Narrator.*

“Aw, hell yeah! I was really hoping you’d say yes! I was really worried you wouldn’t because of how I just walked right up to you and begged you to make out with me.”

*Listener laughs, telling him that she thought his begging was cute.*

“Hey, if you thought the begging was cute, then I’m glad I did it. Hell, I’ll beg for you any time you want.”

(Pause)

“Well, if that’s the case, then can I please, please, please have another kiss? Please? I promise I won’t ask for more than that.”

*Listener (more or less gently) grabs Narrator by the collar of his shirt and drags him into another kiss.*

*Breathless* “Wow. Yeah. That was- That was perfect. I am never, ever going to get tired of that.”

*Narrator laughs as he sheepishly runs a hand through his hair.*

“So, do you want to go get dinner tonight, then? You probably have a few more classes to go to after this, and I have to go shower before my math class, so how about we meet up around six-thirty, near the first floor commons? Does that sound good?”

*Listener responds that it does.*

“Perfect, it’s a date! I’ll see you then! Oh wait, actually, can I have one more kiss? You know, for the road? Just to tide me over until I see you again? Pretty please?”

*Listener gives Narrator a final quick kiss before telling Narrator that she needs to go to her next class but she’ll see him again later.*

*Flirty/joking* “Aw, I don’t want you to go! I miss you being so close to me already! But I guess I’ll be okay, since I have your kisses to keep me warm. I’ll see you later, my beautiful little brainiac. Have fun in class, I can’t wait for our date!”
