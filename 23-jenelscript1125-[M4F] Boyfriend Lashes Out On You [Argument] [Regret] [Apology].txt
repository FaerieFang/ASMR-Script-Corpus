Ugh that get together was shit.. why did [insert name] have to ruin it. I can't believe she was there. [Another person's name] probably invited her. We broke up years ago... And he invited her so that she could say she wanted me back???

(scoff) Bullshit.

She treated me like shit and fucking cheated. She probably wants me back now 'cause I'm successful and running my own company now. Gold-digger...

*annoyed/pissed sigh*

(car door sounds and then a house door sound)

*tired/worn out:

Hey babe....

No I'm fine.

Babe I said I'm fine. It's nothing.

I'm just feeling a bit... moody.. right now.

The get together?... It was alright I guess.

"What's wrong"??

Babe I already told you it's nothing.

Babe there's nothing to tell you. Please. I'm tired and I just got home, please just let me rest. I already ate with the guys, so I'm just gonna go straight to sleep. Goodnight. *





(YAAAAAAAAAWN)

(waking up sounds)

Mgghh.... what time is it?... It's 10 already- Man I slept in a lot...

(getting out of bed and opening door sounds and walking sounds if you want to be extra)

Babe?

(sniff sniff)

You prepared breakfast already?? Awesome what're we having?

[insert a breakfast of your choice, or what you actually had for breakfast.

!!if you haven't eaten breakfast, stop reading this script rn and go eat something and drink water. i'm dead serious]

Ahhh it smells so good!

*munching sounds and forks spoons whatever*

..What are you looking sly about?

Babe not this again-

I- Yeah I've rested now, but still. It's nothing you should worry about.

Babe, please just drop it.

(sigh)

Well I'm gonna go get ready for work.

[whatever length of a pause you want]

Alright I'm off to work. Come here.

(small stip steps)

(small kiss) Thanks for breakfast. See you later babe.


(door sounds)

(long tired sigh/exhale)

Babe I'm home.

Yeah I had to come home a bit later than usual, sorry. One of the guys just didn't show up and apparently he actually had a bunch of shit he didn't do, piled up. So yeah, definitely firing him.

(yawn) Man that was a long day. I'm gonna go get-

*hesitant/nervous

Hm? You want to talk about something?

Er.. Okay. *

*Realisation and then sounding stern

Wait- Is it about-

Babe. This is the last. time. I already told you it's nothing to worry about. *

(short pause)

Wait- You-

*shocked

You what?! You reached out to one of the guys from yesterday to ask what happened?? Babe! *

(irritated sigh)

*a bit nervous/panicked :

Well how much did he tell you?!

(short pause)

Even about [the ex's name]??!!*

Ugh, that idiot- *

*back to irritated

"Why didn't I tell you"??

*angry tone like "do you hear yourself right now?" and the voice is rising

"Why didn't I tell you??"*

*a cold chilling tone

If I wanted you to fucking know,

I would have fucking. told. you.*

*irritated

So what if I never told you I had an ex?*

{practically yelling

SO WHAT IF THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN ACTING DISTANT? } *

*irritated

I can't believe you- *

..

*shocked

What?. *

*disbelief

If I still like her?? *

*snapped

AND WHAT IF I DO-

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?*

*realisation and regret

Wait- Wait no! That's not what-!

(running away footsteps and door slam)

Fuck. *

I think... we both need time to cool off a bit...

(yk the drill, door sounds car driving away, but make it quick cause you come back right away)

(house door opening/closing)

*Nervous/hesitant

Babe, can we talk-*

*confused

Where?....*

(footsteps)

*A little worried

Babe are you still in the bathroom???...*

*more worried and progressively getting more and MORE worried

Wait- are you- Are you crying??

Babe!

Have you been crying in the bathroom for almost an hour???

(knocking on the door)

Babe!! Please open the door!

Babe!

Please don't lock yourself up in there! It's been an hour!

Babe please come out!

Crying for an hour isn't good! You might pass out! Please! *

{any time you want, start the water-works, the voice cracking, like you're on the verge of crying, hiccuping, sobbing, stuttering, sniffing, yk. the usual}

*desperate

Please! Let me apologise to your face!

Babe, I'm begging you! You can hate me all you want, just please come out here!

I- I'll tell you all about my ex, I'll do all the chores for a week! A month! Please, I'll do anything you want, just please!.. *

*really desperate/practically crying

Please come out babe!*

(lock clicking and door opening)

*relief

Babe! Come here-*

(hugging sounds??)

*sobbing

I'm so sorry..

I'm sorry for leaving you alone here to cry for an hour.

I'm sorry for- *crying sound* for being distant lately,

and- and I'm sorry for not telling you about my ex,

*hiccup/sob/sniff* and I'm sorry for treating you like that earlier.

You didn't deserve any of that.

I'm so so sorry. Please forgive me.

*a couple more crying sobbing sounds*

Hm?

*genuine shock/disbelief

What?! No! Of course I don't love her anymore. No! I only love you! I- I was just so upset, and- and I didn't know what I was saying! I'm so sorry I made you feel that way, and that I was being such a jerk, yelling at you like that! I'm sorry babe, please forgive me.

{starting to cry and hiccup less}

*gentle

Here babe, let me carry you to the couch so we're not sitting in the middle of the hall.*

(the sound of slow footsteps and then a thud like you landed on something. or a creak. however you imagine couches to sound)

(relaxing sigh)

{the voice should sound more gentle, slow, and raspy from now on, from crying and begging a lot}

Are you comfortable laying down on me like this?

Alright.. So then I guess I should probably explain myself.

*sigh*

Sooo... [ex's name] was my ex, as you probably know now, and we broke up [insert however many years ago you want, or don't] years ago. We broke up because...

I caught her. Cheating on me.

Yeah. And yesterday, during our get together,

she was there. [the dude's name] invited her, so that she could tell me she wants me back.

I was just. so pissed at both of them. Him for inviting her, and at her because she had the audacity to come back to me after cheating like that. Me and all the rest of my friends knew she just wanted me for money.

I was so pissed yesterday that I just didn't want to talk about it at all. I never told you about her because I just really wanted to bury her in the back of my mind where I forget about everything.

I wanted to pretend she never existed. And I don't want her knowing about you either because she's crazy. She wants money so bad that she'd do really dark messed up things to you if she ever knew about you.

The more I thought about the different terrible things that could happen if she ever found out about you.. The more scared I got. And I ended up lashing out on you.

*really apologetic

The last person I'd ever want to yell at... I'm so sorry babe.*

You.. forgive me?...

*affectionate/relieved sigh*

I won't ever do anything like this again to you. I promise. I'll buy you anything you want tomorrow. Just name it babe, I have a whole day off.

Wh- no?..

"Just spend time together"?..

*if a smile had a sound, make that sound*

Alright babe.

*kiss*

I love you.
